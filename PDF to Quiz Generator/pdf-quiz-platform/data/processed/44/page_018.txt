CYBERSECURITY FOR
SMALL BUSINESS
WHAT TO DO IF YOUR
EMAIL IS SPOOFED
Email authentication helps keep your business’s email from being used in phishing schemes
because it notifies you if someone spoofs your company’s email. If you get that notification,
take these actions:
Report it
Report the scam to local law enforcement, the FBI’s Internet Crime
Complaint Center at IC3.gov, and the FTC at FTC.gov/Complaint. You
also can forward phishing emails to spam@uce.gov (an address used by
the FTC) and to reportphishing@apwg.org (an address used by the
Anti-Phishing Working Group, which includes ISPs, security vendors,
financial institutions, and law enforcement agencies).
Notify your customers
If you find out scammers are impersonating your business, tell your
customers as soon as possible — by mail, email, or social media. If you
email your customers, send an email without hyperlinks: you don’t want
your notification email to look like a phishing scam. Remind customers
not to share any personal information through email or text. And if your
customers’ data was stolen, direct them to IdentityTheft.gov to get a
recovery plan.
Alert your staff
Use this experience to update your security practices and train your staff
about cyber threats.
