2.2.3 Active Attacks
An active attack involves probing the network to discover individual hosts to confirm the
information (IP addresses, operating system type and version, and services on the network)
gathered in the passive attack phase. It involves the risk of detection and is also called “Rattling
the doorknobs” or “Active reconnaissance.” Active reconnaissance can provide confirmation to
an attacker about security measures in place (e.g., whether the front door is locked?), but the
process can also increase the chance of being caught or raise a suspicion.
2.2.4 Scanning and Scrutinizing Gathered Information
Scanning is a key step to examine intelligently while gathering information about the
target.
The objectives of scanning are as follows:
1. Port scanning: Identify open/close ports and services. Refer to Box 2.5.
2. Network scanning: Understand IP Addresses and related information about the
computer network systems.
3. Vulnerability scanning: Understand the existing weaknesses in the system.
2.2.5 Attack (Gaining and Maintaining the System Access)
After the scanning and enumeration, the attack is launched using the following steps:
1. Crack the password.
2. exploit the privileges.
3. execute the malicious commands/applications.
4. hide the files (if required).
5. cover the tracks – delete the access logs, so that there is no trail illicit activity.
