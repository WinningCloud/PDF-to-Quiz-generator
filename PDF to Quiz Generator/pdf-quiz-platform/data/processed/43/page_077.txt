is to use WPA encryption. The attackers always devise new tools and techniques to
deconstruct the older encryption technology, which is quite easy for attackers due to
continuous research in this field. Hence, the second step is to use a long and highly
randomized encryption key; this is very important. It is a little pain to remember long
random encryption; however, at the same time these keys are much harder to crack.
How to Secure the Wireless Networks
Nowadays, security features of Wi-Fi networking products are not that time-consuming
and nonintuitive; however, they are still ignored, especially, by home users. Although following
summarized steps will help to improve and strengthen the security of wireless network, to know
the available tools to monitor and protect the wireless networks:
1. Change the default settings of all the equipments/components of wireless network (e.g., IP
address/ user IDs/administrator passwords, etc.).
2. Enable WPA/WEP encryption.
3. Change the default SSID.
4. Enable MAC address filtering.
5. Disable remote login.
6. Disable SSID broadcast.
7. Disable the features that are not used in the AP (e.g., printing/music support).
8. Avoid providing the network a name which can be easily identified (e.g.,
My_Home_Wifi ).
9. Connect only to secured wireless network (i.e., do not autoconnect to open Wi-Fi
hotspots).
10. Upgrade router’s firmware periodically.
11. Assign static IP addresses to devices.
12. Enable firewalls on each computer and the router.
13. Position the router or AP safely.
14. Turn off the network during extended periods when not in use.
15. Periodic and regular monitor wireless network security.
