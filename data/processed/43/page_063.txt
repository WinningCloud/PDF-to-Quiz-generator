Figure: Virus Spread Through stand alone System
 Computer virus has the ability to copy itself and infect the system.
 The term virus is also commonly but erroneously used to refer to other types of malware,
Adware and Spyware programs that do not have reproductive ability.
 A true virus can only spread from one system to another (in some form of executable code)
when its host is taken to the target computer; for instance, when a user sent it over the
Internet or a network, or carried it on a removable media such as CD, DVD or USB drives.
 Viruses can increase their chances of spreading to other systems by infecting files on a
network file system or a file system that is accessed by another system.
 Malware includes computer viruses, worms, Trojans, most Rootkits, Spyware, dishonest
Adware, crimeware and other malicious and unwanted software as well as true viruses.
 Viruses are sometimes confused with computer worms and Trojan Horses, which are
technically different (see Table 4.7 to understand the difference between computer virus
and worm).
 A worm spreads itself automatically to other computers through networks by exploiting
security vulnerabilities, whereas a Trojan is a code/program that appears to be harmless
but hides malicious functions.
