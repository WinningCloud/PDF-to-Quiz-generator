CYBERSECURITY FOR
SMALL BUSINESS
PROTECT
HOW TO YOUR BUSINESS
Control access
Put controls on databases with sensitive information. Limit access to a need-to-know
basis, and only for the amount of time a vendor needs to do a job.
Use multi-factor authentication
This makes vendors take additional steps beyond logging in with a password to
access your network — like a temporary code on a smartphone or a key that’s
inserted into a computer.
Secure your network
Require strong passwords: at least 12 characters with a mix of numbers, symbols, and
both capital and lowercase letters. Never reuse passwords, don’t share them, and
limit the number of unsuccessful log-in attempts to limit password-guessing attacks.
Safeguard your data
Use properly configured, strong encryption. This protects sensitive information as
it’s transferred and stored.
