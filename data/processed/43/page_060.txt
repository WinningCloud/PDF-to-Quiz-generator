Antikeylogger
 Antikeylogger is a tool that can detect the keylogger installed on the computer system
and can remove the tool. (Visit http://www.anti-keyloggers.com for more information)
Advantages of using antikeylogger are as follows:
1. Firewalls cannot detect the installations of keyloggers on the systems; hence,
antikeyloggers can detect installations of keylogger.
2. This software does not require regular updates of signature bases to work effectively such
as other antivirus and antispy programs; if not updated, it does not serve the purpose, which
makes the users at risk.
3. Prevents Internet banking frauds. Passwords can be easily gained with the help of installing
keyloggers.
4. It prevents ID theft (we will discuss it more in Chapter 5).
5. It secures E-Mail and instant messaging/chatting.
