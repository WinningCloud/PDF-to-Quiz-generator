and presentation of digital evidence derived from digital sources for the purpose of facilitation
or furthering the reconstruction of events found to be criminal, or helping to anticipate
unauthorized actions shown to be disruptive to planned operations.
It is difficult to provide a precise definition of "digital evidence" because the evidence is recovered
from devices that are not traditionally considered to be computers. (Some researchers prefer to
expand the definition by including the "collection" and "examination" of all forms of digital
data, including the data found in cell phones, PDAs, iPods and other electronic devices. In
general, the role of digital forensics is to:
.
1. Uncover and document evidence and leads.
2. Corroborate evidence discovered in other ways (E-Discovery)
3. Assist in showing a pattern of events (data mining has an application here).
4. Connect attack and victim computers (Locard's Exchange Principle)
5. Reveal an end-to-end path of events leading to a compromise attempt, successful or not.
6. Extract data that may be hidden, deleted or otherwise not directly available.
.
The typical scenarios involved are:
1. Employee Internet abuse
2. Data leak/ data breach - unauthorized disclosure of corporate information and data
(accidental and intentional);
3. Industrial espionage (corporate "spying" activities);
4. damage assessment (following an incident);
5. criminal fraud and deception cases;
6. criminals Cases (many criminals simply store information on computers,
intentionally or unwittingly) and countess others;
7. copyright violation
Figure 5.1 shows the kind of data you "see" using forensics tools.
