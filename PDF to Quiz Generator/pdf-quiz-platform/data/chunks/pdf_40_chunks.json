Any illegal act where a special knowledge of computer technology is essential for its perpetration (to\ncommit a crime), investigation or prosecution.\n2. Any traditional crime that has acquired a new dimension or order of magnitude through the aid of a\ncomputer, and abuses that have come into being because of computers.\n3.

Any threats to the computer itself, such as theft of hardware or software, damage and demands for\nmoney.\n5. “Cybercrime (computer crime) is any illegal behavior, directed by means of electronic operations, that\ntargets the security of computer systems and the data processed by them.”\nNote that in a wider sense, “computer-related crime” can be any illegal behavior committed by means of, or\nin relation to, a computer system or network; however, this is not cybercrime. The term “cybercrime” relates to\na number of other terms that may sometimes be used to describe crimes committed using computers.\n• Computer-related crime\n• Computer crime\n• Internet crime\n• E-crime\n• High-tech crime, etc. are the other synonymous terms.\nCybercrime specifically can be defined in a number of ways; a few definitions are:\n1. A crime committed using a computer and the Internet to steal a person’s identity (identity theft) or sell\ncontraband or stalk victims or disrupt operations with malevolent programs.\n2. Crimes completed either on or with a computer.\n3. Any illegal activity done through the Internet or on the computer.\n4. All criminal activities done using the medium of computers, the Internet, cyberspace and the WWW.\nAccording to one information security, cybercrime is any criminal activity which uses network access to\ncommit a criminal act. Cybercrime may be internal or external, with the former easier to perpetrate.

Important Definitions related to Cyber Security: Cyberterrorism: This term was coined in 1997 by Barry Collin, a senior research fellow at the institute for Security and Intelligence in California. Cyberterrorism seems to be a controversial term. The use of information technology and means by terrorist groups & agents is called as Cyberterrorism. “The premeditated use of disruptive activities, or the threat thereof, against computers and/or networks, with the intention to cause harm or further social, ideological, religious, political or similar objectives or to intimidate any person in furtherance of such objectives.” (or) Cyberterrorism is defined as “any person, group or organization who, with terrorist intent, utilizesaccesses or aids in accessing a computer or computer network or electronic system or electronic device by any available means, and thereby knowingly engages in or attempts to engage in a terrorist act commits the offence of cyberterrorism.” Cybernetics: Cybernetics deals with information and its use. Cybernetics is the science that overlaps the fields of neurophysiology, information theory, computing machinery and automation. Worldwide, including India, cyberterrorists usually use computer as a tool, target for their unlawful act to gain information. Internet is one of the means by which the offenders can gain priced sensitive information of companies, J yothi R, Assistant Professor, Dept.of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) 6 firms, individuals, banks and can lead to intellectual property (IP) crimes, selling illegal articles, pornography/child pornography, etc. This is done using methods such as Phishing, Spoofing, Pharming, Internet Phishing, wire transfer, etc. and use it to their own advantage without the consent of the individual. Phishing: Phishing is a cyber attack that uses disguised email as a weapon. The goal is to trick the email recipient into believing that the message is something they want or need a request from their bank, for instance, or a note from someone in their company and to click a link or download an attachment. Phishing is an attempt by an individual or a group to thieve personal confidential information",

(or) Phishing is a form of online identity theft that aims to steal sensitive information such as online banking passwords, credit card information from users etc. Cyberspace: This is a term coined by William Gibson, a science fiction writer in 1984. Cyberspace is where users mentally travel through matrices of data. Conceptually, cyberspace is the nebulous place where humans interact over computer networks. The term “cyberspace” is now used to describe the Internet and other computernetworks. In terms of computer science, “cyberspace” is a worldwide network of computer networks that uses the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) for communication to facilitate transmission and exchange of data. Cyberspace is most definitely a place where you chat, explore, research and play. Cybersquatting: The term is derived from “squatting” which is the act of occupying an abandoned/unoccupied space/ building that the user does not own, rent or otherwise have permission to use. Cybersquatting, however, is a bit different in that the domain names that are being squatted are (sometimes but not always) being paid for by the cybersquatters through the registration process. Cybersquatters usually ask for prices far greater than those at which they purchased it. Some cybersquatters put up derogatory or defamatory remarks about the person or company the domain is meant to represent in an effort to encourage the subject to buy the domain from them. This term is explained herebecause, in a way, it relates to cybercrime given the intent of cybersquatting. J yothi R, Assistant Professor, Dept.of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) 7 Cybersquatting means registering, selling or using a domain name with the intent of profiting from the goodwill of someone else’s trademark. In this nature, it can be considered to be a type of cybercrime. Cybersquatting is the practice of buying “domain names” that have existing businesses names. In India, Cybersquatting is considered to be an Intellectual Property Right (IPR). In India, Cybersquatting is seen to interfere with “Uniform Dispute Resolution Policy” (a contractual obligation to which all domain name registrants are presently subjected to). Cyberpunk: This is a term coined by Bruce Bethke, published in science fiction stories magazine in November 1983. According to",

Cyberpunk: This is a term coined by Bruce Bethke, published in science fiction stories magazine in November 1983. According to science fiction literature, the words “cyber” and “punk” emphasize the two basic aspects of cyberpunk: “technology” and “individualism.” The term “cyberpunk” could mean something like “anarchy via machines” or “machine/computer rebel movement.” Cyberwarfare: Cyberwarfare means information attacks against an unsuspecting opponent’s computer networks, destroying and paralyzing nations. This perception seems to be correct as the terms cyberwarfare and Cyberterrorism have got historical connection in the context of attacks against infrastructure. The term “information infrastructure” refers to information resources, including communication systems that support an industry, institution or population. These type of Cyber attacks are often presented as threat to military forcesand the Internet has major implications for espionage and warfare. CYBERCRIME AND INFORMATION SECURITY Lack of information security gives rise to cybercrimes. Let us refer to the amended Indian Information Technology Act (ITA) 2000 in the context of cybercrime. From an Indian perspective, the new version of the Act (referred to as ITA 2008) provides a new focus on “Information Security in India\". \"Cybersecurity” means protecting information, equipment, devices, computer, computer resource, communication device and information stored therein from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification or destruction. The term incorporates both the physical security of devices as well as the information stored therein. It covers protection from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification and destruction. Where financial losses to the organization due to insider crimes are concerned (e.g., leaking customer data), J yothi R, Assistant Professor, Dept.of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) 8 often some difficulty is faced in estimating the losses because the financial impacts may not be detectedby the victimized organization and no direct costs may be associated with the data theft. The 2008 CSI Surveyon computer crime and security supports this. Cybercrimes occupy an important space in information security domain because of their impact. The other challenge comes from the difficulty in attaching a quantifiable",

Where financial losses to the organization due to insider crimes are concerned (e.g., leaking customer data), J yothi R, Assistant Professor, Dept.of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) 8 often some difficulty is faced in estimating the losses because the financial impacts may not be detectedby the victimized organization and no direct costs may be associated with the data theft. The 2008 CSI Surveyon computer crime and security supports this. Cybercrimes occupy an important space in information security domain because of their impact. The other challenge comes from the difficulty in attaching a quantifiable monetary value to the corporate data and yet corporate data get stolen/lost (through loss/theft of laptops). Because of these reasons, reporting of financial losses often remains approximate. In an attempt to avoid negative publicity, most organizations abstain from revealing facts and figures about “security incidents” including cybercrime. In general, organizations perception about “insider attacks” seems to be different thanthat made out by security solution vendor. However, this perception of an organization does not seem to be trueas revealed by the 2008 CSI Survey. Awareness about “data privacy” too tends to be low in most organizations. When we speak of financial losses to the organization and significant insider crimes, such as leaking customer data, such “crimes” may not be detected by the victimized organization and no direct costs may be associated with the theft Figure: Cybercrime trend over the years J yothi R, Assistant Professor, Dept.of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) 9 Figure: shows several categories of incidences – viruses, insider abuse, laptop theft and unauthorized access to systems The Botnet Menace: A group of computers that are controlled",

Smishing (SMS phishing) is a type of phishing attack conducted using SMS (Short Message Services) on cell phones. Just like email phishing scams, smishing messages typically include a threat or enticement to click a link or call a number and hand over sensitive information. Sometimes they might suggest you install some security software, which turns out to be malware. Smishing example: A typical smishing text message might say something along the lines of, “Your ABC Bank account has been suspended. To unlock your account, tap here: https://bit.ly/2LPLdaU” and thelink provided will download malware onto your phone. Scammers are also adept at adjusting to the medium they’re using, so you might get a text message that says, “Is this really a pic of you? https://bit.ly/2LPLdaU” and if you tap that link to find out, once again you’re downloading malware. 4. Spamming: People who create electronic Spam are called spammers. Spam is the abuse of electronicmessaging systems (including most broadcast media, digital delivery systems) to send unrequested bulk messages indiscriminately. Although the most widely recognized form of Spam is E-Mail Spam, the term is applied to similar abuses in other media: instant messaging Spam, Usenet newsgroup Spam, web search engine Spam, Spam in blogs, wiki Spam, online classified ads Spam, mobile phone messaging Spam, Internet forum Spam, junk fax transmissions, social networking Spam, file sharing network Spam, video sharing sites, etc. Spamming is difficult to control because it has economic viability – advertisers have no operating costs beyond the management of their mailing lists, and it is difficult to hold senders accountable for their mass mailings. Spammers are numerous; the volume of unrequested mail has become very high because the barrier to entry is low. Therefore, the following web publishing techniques should be avoided:  Repeating keywords;  use of keywords that do not relate to the content on the site; J yothi R, Assistant Professor, Dept.of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) 15  use of fast meta refresh;  redirection;  IP Cloaking;  use of colored text on the same color background;  tiny text usage;  duplication of pages with different URLs;  hidden links;  use of different pages that bridge to the same URL (gateway pages). 5. Cyber defamation: It is a cognizable (Software) offense. “Whoever, by words either spoken or intended to be read, or by signs or by visible representations, makes or publishes any imputation concerning any person intending to harm, or knowing or having reason to believe that such imputation will harm, the reputation ofsuch person, is said, except in the cases hereinafter expected, to defame that person.” Cyber defamation happens when the above takes place in an electronic form.",

In other words, cyber defamation occurs when defamation takes place with the help of computers and/or the Internet. For example, someone publishes defamatory matter about someone on a website or sends an E-Mail containing defamatory information to all friends of that person. 6. Cyberstalking and harassment: The dictionary meaning of “stalking” is an “act or process of following prey stealthily – trying to approach somebody or something.” Cyberstalking has been defined as the use of information and communications technology, particularly the Internet, by an individual or group of individualsto harass another individual, group of individuals, or organization. The behavior includes false accusations, monitoring, transmission of threats, ID theft, damage to data or equipment, solicitation of minors for sexual purposes, and gathering information for harassment purposes. As the internet has become an integral part of our personal & professional lives, cyberstalkers take advantage of ease of communication & an increased access to personal information available with a few mouse clicks or keystrokes. They are 2 types of stalkers: Online Stalkers: aim to start the interaction with the victim directly with the help of the internet. Offline Stalkers: the stalker may begin the attack using traditional methods such as following the victim, watching the daily routine of the victim. 7. Computer Sabotage: The use of the Internet to stop the normal functioning of a computer system through the introduction of worms, viruses or logic bombs, is referred to as computer sabotage. It can be used to gain economic advantage over a competitor, to promote the illegal activities of terrorists or to steal data or programs for extortion purposes. Logic bombs are event-dependent programs created to do something only when a certain event (known J yothi R, Assistant Professor, Dept.of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) 16 as a trigger event) occurs. Some viruses may be termed as logic bombs because they lie dormantall through the year and become active only on a particular date. 8. Pornographic Offenses: Child pornography means any visual depiction, including but not limited to the following: 1. Any photograph that can be considered obscene and/or unsuitable for the age of child viewer; 2. film, video, picture; 3. computer-generated image or picture of sexually explicit conduct where the production of such visual depiction involves the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct. Child Pornography is considered an offense. The internet is being highly used by its abusers to reach and abuse children sexually, worldwide.

The Internet has become a household commodity in the urban areas of the nation. Its explosion has made the children a viable victim to the cybercrime. As the broad-band connections get intothe reach of more and more homes, larger child population will be using the Internet and therefore greaterwould be the chances of falling victim to the aggression of pedophiles. Pedophiles are the people who physically or psychologically coerce minors to engage in sexual activities, which the minors would not consciously consent too. Here is how pedophiles operate:  Step 1: Pedophiles use a false identity to trap the children/teenagers.  Step 2: They seek children/teens in the kids’ areas on the services, such as the Games BB or chat areas where the children gather.  Step 3: They befriend children/teens.  Step 4: They extract personal information from the child/teen by winning his/her confidence.  Step 5: Pedophiles get E-Mail address of the child/teen and start making contacts on the victim’s E-Mail address as well. Sometimes, these E-Mails contain sexually explicit language.  Step 6: They start sending pornographic images/text to the victim including child pornographic images in order to help child/teen shed his/her inhibitions so that a feeling is created in the mind of the victim that what is being fed to him is normal and that everybody does it.  Step 7: At the end of it, the pedophiles set up a meeting with the child/teen out of the house and then drag him/her into the net to further sexually assault him/her or to use him/her as a sex object. 9. Password Sniffing: is a hacking technique that uses a special software application that allows a hacker to steal usernames and passwords simply by observing and passively recording network traffic. This often happens on public WiFi networks where it is relatively easy to spy on weak or unencrypted traffic. And yet, password sniffers aren’t always used for malicious intent. They are often used by IT professionals J yothi R, Assistant Professor, Dept.of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) 17 as a tool to identify weak applications that may be passing critical information unencrypted over the Local Area Network (LAN). IT practitioners know that users download and install risky software at times in their environment, running a passive password sniffer on the network of a business to identify leaky applications is one legitimate use of a password sniffer. Cybercrime against property 1. Credit Card Frauds: Credit card fraud is an inclusive term for fraud committed using a payment card, such as a credit card or debit card. The purpose may be to obtain goods or services, or to make payment to another account which is controlled by a criminal. The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is the data security standard created to help businesses process card payments securely and reduce card fraud.

The purpose may be to obtain goods or services, or to make payment to another account which is controlled by a criminal. The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is the data security standard created to help businesses process card payments securely and reduce card fraud. Credit card fraud can be authorised, where the genuine customer themselves processes a payment to another account which is controlled by a criminal, or unauthorised, where the account holder does not provide authorisation for the payment to proceed and the transaction is carried out by a third party. Credit cards are more secure than ever, with regulators, card providers and banks taking considerable time and effort to collaborate with investigators worldwide to ensure fraudsters aren't successful. Cardholders' money is usually protected from scammers with regulations that make the card provider and bank accountable. The technology and security measures behind credit cards are becoming increasingly sophisticated making it harder for fraudsters to steal money. 2. Intellectual Property (IP) Crimes: With the growth in the use of internet these days the cyber crimes are also growing. Cyber theft of Intellectual Property (IP) is one of them. Cyber theft of IP means stealing of copyrights, software piracy, trade secrets, patents etc., using internet and computers. Copyrights and trade secrets are the two forms of IP that is frequently stolen. For example, stealing of software, business strategies etc. Generally, the stolen material is sold to the rivals or others for further sale of the product. This may result in the huge loss to the company who originally created it. Another major cyber theft of IP faced by India is piracy. These days one can get pirated version of movies, software etc. The piracy results in a huge loss of revenue to the copyright holder. It is difficult to find the cyber thieves and punish them because everything they do is over internet, so they erase the data immediately and disappear within fraction of a second.  Internet time theft: Such a theft occurs when an unauthorized person uses the Internet hours paid for by another person. Basically, Internet time theft comes under hacking because the person who gets access to someone else’s ISP user ID and password, either by hacking or by gaining access to it by illegal means,uses it to J yothi R, Assistant Professor, Dept.of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) 18 access the Internet without the other person’s knowledge. However, one can identify time theft ifthe Internet time has to be recharged often, even when one’s own use of the Internet is not frequent. The issue of Internet time theft is related to the crimes conducted through identity theft. Cybercrime against Organization 1. Unauthorized accessing of Computer: Hacking is one method of doing this and hacking is punishable offense. Unauthorized computer access, popularly referred to as hacking, describes a criminal action whereby someone uses a computer to knowingly gain access to data in a system without permission toaccess that data. 2.

Password Sniffing: Password Sniffers are programs that monitor and record the name and password of network users as they login, jeopardizing security at a site. Whoever installs the Sniffer can then impersonate an authorized user and login to access restricted documents. Laws are not yet set up to adequately prosecute a person for impersonating another person online. Laws designed to prevent unauthorized access to information may be effective in apprehending crackers using Sniffer programs. 3. Denial-of-service Attacks (DoS Attacks): It is an attempt to make a computer resource (i.e.., information systems) unavailable to its intended users. In this type of criminal act, the attacker floods the bandwidth of the victim’s network or fills his E-Mail box with spam mail depriving him of the services he is entitled to access or provide. The goal of DoS is not to gain unauthorized access to systems or data, but to prevent intended users (i.e., legitimate users) of a service from using it. A DoS attack may do the following: a. Flood a network with traffic, thereby preventing legitimate network traffic. b. Disrupt connections between two systems, thereby preventing access to a service. c. Prevent a particular individual from accessing a service. d. Disrupt service to a specifi c system or person. 4. Virus attacks/dissemination of Viruses: Computer virus is a program that can “infect” legitimate (valid) programs by modifying them to include a possibly “evolved” copy of itself. Viruses spread themselves, without the knowledge or permission of the users, to potentially large numbers of programs on many machines. A computer virus passes from computer to computer in a similar manner as a biological virus passes from person to person. Viruses may also contain malicious instructions that may cause damage or annoyance; the combination of possibly Malicious Code with the ability to spread is what makes viruses a considerable concern. Viruses can often spread without any readily visible symptoms. Viruses can take some typical actions: J yothi R, Assistant Professor, Dept.of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) 19  Display a message to prompt an action which may set of the virus  Delete files inside the system into which viruses enter  Scramble data on a hard disk  Cause erratic screen behavior  Halt the system (PC)  Just replicate themselves to propagate further harm 5. E-Mail bombing/Mail bombs: E-Mail bombing refers to sending a large number of E-Mails to the victim to crash victim’s E-Mail account (in the case of an individual) or to make victim’s mail servers crash (in the case of a company or an E-Mail service provider). Computer program can be written to instruct a computer to do such tasks on a repeated basis. In recent times, terrorism has hit the Internet in the form of mail bombings.

Computer program can be written to instruct a computer to do such tasks on a repeated basis. In recent times, terrorism has hit the Internet in the form of mail bombings. By instructing a computer to repeatedly send E-Mail to a specified person’s E-Mail address, the cybercriminal can overwhelm the recipient’s personal account and potentially shut down entire systems. This may or may not be illegal, but it is certainly disruptive. 6. Salami Attack/Salami technique: These attacks are used for committing financial crimes. The idea here is to make the alteration so insignificant that in a single case it would go completely unnoticed; For example a bank employee inserts a program, into the bank’s servers, that deducts a small amount of money (say Rs.2/- or a few cents in a month) from the account of every customer. No account holder will probably notice this unauthorized debit, but the bank employee will make a sizable amount every month. 7. Logic Bomb: A Logic Bomb is a piece of often-malicious code that is intentionally inserted into software. It is activated upon the host network only when certain conditions are met. Some viruses may be termed as logic bombs because they lie dormant all through the year and become active only on a particular date. 8. Trojan Horse: A Trojan Horse, Trojan for short, is a term used to describe malware that appears, to the user, to perform a desirable function but, in fact, facilitates unauthorized access to the user’s computer system. 9. Data Diddling: A data diddling (data cheating) attack involves altering raw data just before it is processed by a computer and then changing it back after the processing is completed. Electricity Boards in India have been victims to data diddling programs inserted when private parties computerize their systems. 10. Newsgroup Spam/Crimes emanating from Usenet newsgroup: This is one form of spamming. The word “Spam” was usually taken to mean Excessive Multiple Posting (EMP). The advent of Google Groups, and its large Usenet archive, has made Usenet more attractive to spammers than ever. Spamming of Usenet newsgroups actually predates E-Mail Spam. 11. Industrial spying/Industrial espionage: Spying is not limited to governments. Corporations, like J yothi R, Assistant Professor, Dept.of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) 20 governments, often spy on the enemy. The Internet and privately networked systems provide new and better opportunities for espionage. “Spies” can get information about product finances, research and development and marketing strategies, an activity known as “industrial spying.” However, cyberspies rarely leave behind a trail. Industrial spying is not new; in fact it is as old as industries themselves. The use of the Internet to achieve this is probably as old as the Internet itself. Traditionally, this has been the reserved hunting field of a few hundreds of highly skilled hackers, contracted by high-profile companies or certain governments via the means of registered organizations (it is said that they get several hundreds of thousands of dollars, depending on the “assignment”).

With the growing public availability of Trojans and Spyware material, even low-skilled individuals are now inclinedto generate high volume profit out of industrial spying. This is referred to as “Targeted Attacks” (which includes “Spear Phishing”). 12. Computer network intrusions: “Crackers” who are often misnamed “Hackers can break into computer systems from anywhere in the world and steal data, plant viruses, create backdoors, insert Trojan Horses or change user names and passwords. Network intrusions are illegal, but detection and enforcement are difficult. Current laws are limited and many intrusions go undetected. The cracker can bypass existing password protection by creating a program to capture logon IDs and passwords. The practice of “strong password” is therefore important. 13. Software piracy: This is a big challenge area indeed. Cybercrime investigation cell of India defines“software piracy” as theft of software through the illegal copying of genuine programs or the counterfeiting and distribution of products intended to pass for the original. There are many examples of software piracy: 1. end-user copying: friends loaning disks to each other, or organizations under-reporting the number of software installations they have made, or organizations not tracking their software licenses; 2. hard disk loading with illicit means: hard disk vendors load pirated software; 3. counterfeiting: large-scale duplication and distribution of illegally copied software; 4. Illegal downloads from the Internet: by intrusion, by cracking serial numbers, etc. Beware that those who buy pirated software have a lot to lose:  getting untested software that may have been copied thousands of times over,  the software, if pirated, may potentially contain hard-drive-infecting viruses,  there is no technical support in the case of software failure, that is, lack of technical product support available to properly licensed users,  there is no warranty protection, J yothi R, Assistant Professor, Dept.of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) 21  there is no legal right to use the product, etc. Cybercrime against Society 1. Forgery: Counterfeit currency notes, postage and revenue stamps, marksheets, etc. can be forged using sophisticated computers, printers and scanners. Outside many colleges there are miscreants soliciting the sale of fake mark-sheets or even degree certificates. These are made using computers and high quality scanners and printers. In fact, this is becoming a booming business involving large monetary amount givento student gangs in exchange for these bogus but authentic looking certificates. 2.

Cyberterrorism: Cyberterrorism is a controversial term. Cyberterrorism is the use of the Internet to conduct violent acts that result in, or threaten, loss of life or significant bodily harm, in order to achieve political or ideological gains through threat or intimidation. It is also sometimes considered an act ofInternet terrorism where terrorist activities, including acts of deliberate, large-scale disruption of computer networks, especially of personal computers attached to the Internet by means of tools such as computer viruses, computer worms, phishing, and other malicious software and hardware methods and programming scripts. 3. Web Jacking: Web jacking occurs when someone forcefully takes control of a website (by cracking the password and later changing it). Thus, the first stage of this crime involves “password sniffing”. The actual owner of the website does not have any more control over what appears on that website. Crimes emanating from Usenet newsgroup: By its very nature, Usenet groups may carry very offensive, harmful, inaccurate or otherwise inappropriate material, or in some cases, postings that have been mislabeled or are deceptive in another way. Therefore, it is expected that you will use caution and common sense and exercise proper judgment when using Usenet, as well as use the service at your own risk. Usenet is a popular means of sharing and distributing information on the Web with respect to specific topic or subjects. Usenet is a mechanism that allows sharing information in a many-to-many manner. The newsgroups are spread across 30,000 different topics. J yothi R, Assistant Professor, Dept.of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) 22 CYBERCRIME: THE LEGAL PERSPECTIVES  Cybercrime poses a biggest challenge.  Computer Crime: As per “Criminal Justice Resource Manual (1979)”, computer-related crime was defined in the broader meaning as: “any illegal act for which knowledge of computer technology is essential for a successful prosecution”.  International legal aspects of computer crimes were studied in 1983.  In that study, computer crime was consequently defined as: “encompasses any illegal act for which knowledge of computer technology is essential for its commit”.  Cybercrime, in a way, is the outcome of “globalization.” However, globalization does not mean globalized welfare at all.  Globalized information systems accommodate an increasing number of transnational offenses. ",

Although all ancient empires including Rome, Greece and Mongolia became historical remnants, and giant empires are not prevalent in current world, the partitionof information systems cannot be an imagined practice.  In a globally connected world, information systems become the unique empire without tangible territory. CYBERCRIMES: AN INDIAN PERSPECTIVE India has the fourth highest number of Internet users in the world. According to the statistics posted on the site (http://www.iamai.in/), there are 45 million Internet users in India, 37% of all Internet accesses happen from cybercafés and 57% of Indian Internet users are between 18 and 35 years. The population of educatedyouth is high in India. It is reported that compared to the year 2006, cybercrime under the Information Technology (IT) Act recorded a whopping 50% increase in the year 2007. A point to note is that the majority of offenders were under 30 years. The maximum cybercrime cases, about 46%, were related to incidents of cyberpornography, followed by hacking. In over 60% of these cases, offenders were between 18 and 30 years, J yothi R, Assistant Professor, Dept.of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) 23 according to the “Crime in 2007” report of the National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB). Cybercrimes: Indian Statistics: Cybercrimes: Cases of various categories under ITA 2000: 217 cases were registered under IT Act during the year 2007 as compared to 142 cases during the previous year 2006, with an increase of 52.8%. 99 cases of the total 217 cases registered under ITA 2000 were related to obscene publication/transmission in electronic form known as cyberpornography. There were 76 cases of hacking with computer system which is related to loss/damage of computer resource/utility. India is said to be “youth country” given the population age distribution. However from cybercrime perspective, this youth aspect does not seem good as revealed by cybercrime statistics in India.",

In over 60% of these cases, offenders were between 18 and 30 years, J yothi R, Assistant Professor, Dept.of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) 23 according to the “Crime in 2007” report of the National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB). Cybercrimes: Indian Statistics: Cybercrimes: Cases of various categories under ITA 2000: 217 cases were registered under IT Act during the year 2007 as compared to 142 cases during the previous year 2006, with an increase of 52.8%. 99 cases of the total 217 cases registered under ITA 2000 were related to obscene publication/transmission in electronic form known as cyberpornography. There were 76 cases of hacking with computer system which is related to loss/damage of computer resource/utility. India is said to be “youth country” given the population age distribution. However from cybercrime perspective, this youth aspect does not seem good as revealed by cybercrime statistics in India. Cybercrimes: Cases of various categories under IPC Section: A total of 339 cases were registered under IPC sections during the year 2007 as compared to 311 such cases during 2006, thereby reporting an increase of 9%. Majority of the crimes out of total 339 cases registered under IPC fall under 2 categories i.e.., Forgery & Criminal breach of Trust or Fraud. Incidence of Cybercrimes in cities: 17 out of 35 mega cities did not report any case of cybercrime (neither under the IT Act nor under IPC Sections) during the year 2007. A total of 17 mega cities have reported 118 cases under IT Act and 7 mega cities reported 180 cases under various sections of IPC. The Indian Government is doing its best to control cybercrimes. For example, Delhi Police have now trained 100 of its officers in handling cybercrime and placed them in its Economic Offences Wing. As at the time of writing this, the officers were trained for 6 weeks in computer hardware and software, computer networks comprising data communication networks, network protocols, wireless networks and network security. CYBERCRIME & THE INDIAN ITA 2000 In India, the ITA 2000 was enacted after the United Nation General Assembly ResolutionA/RES/51/162 in January 30, 1997 by adopting the Model Law on Electronic Commerce adopted by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law. This was the first step toward the Law relating to E- Commerce at international level to regulate an alternative form of commerce and to give legal status in the areaof E-Commerce. It was enacted taking into consideration UNICITRAL model of Law on Electronic Commerce (1996).

In the Council of Europe’s (CoE’s) Cyber Crime Treaty, cybercrime is used as an umbrella term to refer to an array of criminal activity including offenses against computer data and systems, computer- related offenses, content offenses and copyright offenses. This wide definition of cybercrime overlaps in part with general offense categories that need not be Information & Communication Technology (ICT)-dependent, such as white-collar crime and economic crime. Although this status is from the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) survey conducted in 2005, we get an idea about the global perspective. ITU activities on countering Spam can be read by visiting the link www.itu.int/spam (8 May 2010). The Spam legislation scenario mentions “none” about India as far as E-Mail legislation in India is concerned. The linkage of cybersecurity and critical infrastructure protection has become a big issue as a number of countries have began assessment of threats, vulnerabilities and started exploring mechanisms to redress them. Recently, there have been a number of significant developments such as 1. August 4, 2006 Announcement: The US Senate ratifies CoE Convention on Cyber Crime. The convention targets hackers, those spreading destructive computer viruses, those using the Internet for the sexual exploitation of children or the distribution of racist material, and terrorists attempting to attack infrastructure facilities or financial institutions. The Convention is in full accord with all the US constitutional protections, such as free speech and other civil liberties, and will require no change to the US laws. 2. In August 18, 2006, there was a news article published “ISPs Wary About ‘Drastic Obligations’ on Web Site Blocking.” European Union (EU) officials want to debar suspicious websites as part of a 6-point plan to boost joint antiterrorism activities. They want to block websites that incite terrorist action. Once again it is underlined that monitoring calls, Internet and E-Mail traffic for law enforcement purposes is a J yothi R, Assistant Professor, Dept.of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) 26 task vested in the government, which must reimburse carriers and providers for retaining the data. 3. CoE Cyber Crime Convention (1997–2001) was the first international treaty seeking to address Internet crimes by harmonizing national laws, improving investigative techniques and increasing cooperation among nations. More than 40 countries have ratified the Convention to date.

Cybercrime and the Extended Enterprise: It is a continuing problem that the average user is not adequately educated to understand the threats and how to protect oneself. Actually, it is the responsibility of each user to become aware of the threats as well asthe opportunities that “connectivity” and “mobility” presents them with. In this context, it is important to understand the concept of “extended enterprise.” This term represents the concept that a company is made upnot just of its employees, its board members and executives, but also its business partners, its suppliers and even its customers. Figure: Extended Enterprise The extended enterprise can only be successful if all of the component groups and individuals have the information they need in order to do business effectively. An extended enterprise is a “loosely coupled, self- organizing network” of firms that combine their economic output to provide “products and services” offerings to the market. Firms in the extended enterprise may operate independently. Seamless flow of “information” to support instantaneous “decision-making ability” is crucial for the “external enterprise”. This becomes possible through the “interconnectedness”. Due to the interconnected features of information & communication technologies, security overall can only be fully promoted when the users have full awareness of existing threats & dangers. Given the promises and challenges in the extended enterprise scenario, organizations in the international community have a special role in sharing information on good practices and creating open and accessible enterprise information flow channels for exchanging of ideas in a collaborative manner.

Perseverance For ensuring cyber safety, the motto for the “Netizen” should be “Stranger is Danger!” If you protect your customer’s data, your employee’s privacy and your own company, then you are doing your job in the grander scheme of things to regulate and enforce rules on the Net through our community. NASSCOM urges that cybercrime awareness is important, and any matter should be reported at once. This is the reason they have established cyberlabs across major cities in India More importantly, users must try and save any electronic information trail on their computers. That is all one can do until laws become more stringent or technology more advanced. Some agencies have been advocating for the need to address protection of the Rights of Netizens. There are agencies that are trying to provide guidance to innocent victims of cybercrimes. However, these NGO like efforts cannot provide complete support to the victims of cybercrimes and are unable to get the necessary support from the Police. There are alsoa few incidents where Police have pursued false cases on innocent IT professionals. The need for a statutorily empowered agency to protect abuse of ITA 2000 in India was, therefore, a felt need for quite some time.

Box 2.1 | Hackers, Crackers and Phreakers Hacker: A hacker is a person with a strong interest in computers who enjoys learning and experimenting with them. Hackers are usually very talented, smart people who understand computers better than others. The term is often confused with cracker that defines someone who breaks into computers (refer to Box 2.2). Brute force hacking: It is a technique used to find passwords or encryption keys. Brute force hacking involves trying every possible combination of letters, numbers, etc., until the code is broken. Cracker: A cracker is a person who breaks into computers. Crackers should not be confused with hackers. The term “cracker” is usually connected to computer criminals. Some of their crimes include vandalism, theft and snooping in unauthorized areas. Cracking: It is the act of breaking into computers. Cracking is a popular, growing subject on the Internet. Many sites are devoted to supplying crackers with programs that allow them to crack computers. Some of these programs contain dictionaries for guessing passwords. Others are used to break into phone lines (called “phreaking”). These sites usually display warnings such as “These files are illegal; we are not responsible for what you do with them.” Cracker tools: These are programs used to break into computers. Cracker tools are widely distributed on the Internet. They include password crackers, Trojans, viruses, war dialers and worms. Phreaking: This is the notorious art of breaking into phone or other communication systems. Phreaking sites on the Internet are popular among crackers and other criminals. War dialer: Program automatically dials phone numbers looking for computers on the other end. It catalogs numbers so that the hackers can call back and try to break in. An attacker would look to exploit the vulnerabilities in the networks, most often so because the networks are not adequately protected.  The categories of vulnerabilities that hackers typically search for are the following: o Inadequate border protection (border as in the sense of network periphery); o remote access servers (RASs) with weak access controls; o application servers with well-known exploits; o misconfigured systems and systems with default configurations.  To help the reader understand the network attack scenario, Fig. 2.2 illustrates a small network highlighting specific occurrences of several vulnerabilities described above. Box 2.2 | What Color is Your Hat in the Security World? A black hat is also called a “cracker” or “dark side hacker.” Such a person is a malicious or criminal hacker.

In computer terminology, the meaning of “hacker” can be much broader. The name comes from the opposite of “white hat hackers.” A white hat hacker is considered an ethical hacker. In the realm of IT, a “white hat hacker” is a person who is ethically opposed to the abuse of computer systems. It is said that the term is derived from American western movies, where the protagonist typically wore a white cowboy hat and the antagonist typically wore a black one. As a simplified explanation, a “white hat” generally focuses on securing IT systems, whereas a “black hat” (the opposite) would like to break into them, so this sounds like an age-old game of a thief and a police. A brown hat hacker is one who thinks before acting or committing a malice or non-malice deed. A grey hat commonly refers to a hacker who releases information about any exploits or security holes he/she finds openly to the public. He/she does so without concern for how the information is used in the end (whether for patching or exploiting). 2.1.1 Categories of Cybercrime Cybercrime can be categorized based on the following: 1. The target of the crime and 2. whether the crime occurs as a single event or as a series of events. Cybercrime can be targeted against individuals (persons), assets (property) and/or organizations (government, business and social). 1. Crimes targeted at individuals: The goal is to exploit human weakness such as greed and naivety. These crimes include financial frauds, sale of non-existent or stolen items, child pornography (explained in Section 1.5.13, Chapter 1), copyright violation, harassment, etc. with the development in the IT and the Internet; thus, criminals have a new tool that allows them to expand the pool of potential victims. However, this also makes difficult to trace and apprehend the criminals. 2. Crimes targeted at property: This includes stealing mobile devices such as cell phone, laptops, personal digital assistant (PDAs), and removable medias (CDs and pen drives); transmitting harmful programs that can disrupt functions of the systems and/or can wipe out data from hard disk, and can create the malfunctioning of the attached devices in the system such as modem, CD drive, etc. 3. Crimes targeted at organizations: Cyber terrorism is one of the distinct crimes against organizations/ governments. Attackers (individuals or groups of individuals) use computer tools and the Internet to usually terrorize the citizens of a particular country by stealing the private information, and also to damage the programs and fi les or plant programs to get control of the network and/or system (see Box 2.3). 4. Single event of cybercrime: It is the single event from the perspective of the victim. For example, unknowingly open an attachment that may contain virus that will infect the system (PC/laptop). This is known as hacking or fraud. 5. Series of events: This involves attacker interacting with the victims repetitively. For example, attacker interacts with the victim on the phone and/or via",

Box 2.3 | Patriot Hacking Patriot hacking[1] also known as Digital Warfare, is a form of vigilante computer systems’ cracking done by individuals or groups (usually citizens or supports of a country) against a real or perceived threat. Traditionally, Western countries, that is, developing countries, attempts to launch attacks on their perceived enemies. Although patriot hacking is declared as illegal in the US, however, it is reserved only for government agencies [i.e., Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and National Security Agency (NSA)] as a legitimate form of attack and defense. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) raised the concern about rise in cyber attacks like website defacements (explained in Box 1.4, Chapter1) and denial-of-service attacks (DoS – refer to Section 4.9, Chapter 4), which adds as fuel into increase in international tension and gets mirrored it into the online world. After the war in Iraq in 2003, it is getting popular in the North America, Western Europe and Israel. These are countries that have the greatest threat to Islamic terrorism and its aforementioned digital version. The People’s Republic of China is allegedly making attacks upon the computer networks of the US and the UK. Refer to Box 5.15 in Chapter 5. For detailed information visit www.patriothacking.com 2.2 How Criminals Plan the Attacks  Criminals use many methods and tools to locate the vulnerabilities of their target.  The target can be an individual and/or an organization.  Criminals plan passive and active attacks  Active attacks are usually used to alter the system (i.e., computer network) whereas passive attacks attempt to gain information about the target.  Active attacks may affect the availability, integrity and authenticity of data whereas passive attacks lead to violation of confidentiality. The following phases are involved in planning cybercrime: 1. Reconnaissance (information gathering) is the first phase and is treated as passive attacks. 2. Scanning and scrutinizing the gathered information for the validity of the information as well as to identify the existing vulnerabilities. 3. Launching an attack (gaining and maintaining the system access). 2.2.1 Reconnaissance (reconnaissance= 9ఘa)  The literal meaning of “Reconnaissance” is an act of finding something or somebody (especially to gain information about an enemy or potential enemy).  In the world of “hacking,” reconnaissance phase begins with “Footprinting” – this is the preparation toward pre-attack phase, and involves accumulating data about the target’s environment and computer architecture",

Let us understand these two phases. 2.2.2 Passive Attacks A passive attack involves gathering information about a target without his/her (individual’s or company’s) knowledge. It can be as simple as watching a building to identify what time employees enter the building premises. However, it is usually done using Internet searches or by Googling (i.e., searching the required information with the help of search engine Google) an individual or company to gain information. 1. Google or Yahoo search: People search to locate information about employees. 2. Surfing online community groups like Orkut/Facebook will prove useful to gain the information about an individual. 3. Organization’s website may provide a personnel directory or information about key employees, for example, contact details, E-Mail address, etc. These can be used in a social engineering attack to reach the target (see Section 2.3). 4. Blogs, newsgroups, press releases, etc. are generally used as the mediums to gain information about the company or employees. 5. Going through the job postings in particular job profiles for technical persons can provide information about type of technology, that is, servers or infrastructure devices a company maybe using on its network. 2.2.3 Active Attacks An active attack involves probing the network to discover individual hosts to confirm the information (IP addresses, operating system type and version, and services on the network) gathered in the passive attack phase. It involves the risk of detection and is also called “Rattling the doorknobs” or “Active reconnaissance.” Active reconnaissance can provide confirmation to an attacker about security",

It involves the risk of detection and is also called “Rattling the doorknobs” or “Active reconnaissance.” Active reconnaissance can provide confirmation to an attacker about security measures in place (e.g., whether the front door is locked?), but the process can also increase the chance of being caught or raise a suspicion. 2.2.4 Scanning and Scrutinizing Gathered Information Scanning is a key step to examine intelligently while gathering information about the target. The objectives of scanning are as follows: 1. Port scanning: Identify open/close ports and services. Refer to Box 2.5. 2. Network scanning: Understand IP Addresses and related information about the computer network systems. 3. Vulnerability scanning: Understand the existing weaknesses in the system. 2.2.5 Attack (Gaining and Maintaining the System Access) After the scanning and enumeration, the attack is launched using the following steps: 1. Crack the password. 2. exploit the privileges. 3. execute the malicious commands/applications. 4. hide the files (if required). 5. cover the tracks – delete the access logs, so that there is no trail illicit activity. 2.3 Social Engineering  Social engineering is the “technique to influence” and “persuasion to deceive” people to obtain the information or perform some action.  Social engineers exploit the natural tendency of a person to trust social engineers’ word, rather than exploiting computer security holes.  It is generally agreed that people are the weak link in security and this principle makes social engineering possible.  A social engineer usually uses telecommunication (i.e., telephone and/or cell phone) or Internet to get them to do something that is against the security practices and/or policies of the organization.  Social engineering involves gaining sensitive information or unauthorized access privileges by building inappropriate trust relationships with insiders.  It is an art of exploiting the trust of people, which is not",

Impersonating an employee or valid user:  “Impersonation” is perhaps the greatest technique used by social engineers to deceive people.  Social engineers “take advantage” of the fact that most people are basically helpful, so it seems harmless to tell someone who appears to be lost where the computer room is located, or to let someone into the building who “forgot” his/her badge, etc., or pretending to be an employee or valid user on the system. 2. Posing as an important user:  The attacker pretends to be an important user – for example, a Chief Executive Officer (CEO) or high-level manager who needs immediate assistance to gain access to a system.  The attacker uses intimidation so that a lower-level employee such as a help-desk worker will help him/her in gaining access to the system. Most of the low-level employees will not ask any question to someone who appears to be in a position of authority. 3. Using a third person:  An attacker pretends to have permission from an authorized source to use a system. This trick is useful when the supposed authorized personnel is on vacation or cannot be contacted for verification. 4. Calling technical support:  Calling the technical support for assistance is a classic social engineering example.  Help-desk and technical support personnel are trained to help users, which makes them good prey for social engineering attacks. 5. Shoulder surfing:  It is a technique of gathering information such as usernames and passwords by watching over a person’s shoulder while he/she logs into the system, thereby helping an attacker to gain access to the system. 6. Dumpster diving:  It involves looking in the trash for information written on pieces of paper or computer printouts.  This is a typical North American term; it is used to describe the practice of rummaging through commercial or residential trash to find useful free items that have been discarded.  It is also called dumpstering, binning, trashing, garbing or garbage gleaning.  “Scavenging” is another term to describe these habits.  In the UK, the practice is referred to as “ binning” or “skipping” and the person doing it is a “binner” or a “skipper.” Computer-Based Social Engineering  Computer-based social engineering refers to an attempt made to get the required/desired information by using computer software/Internet.  For example, sending a fake E-Mail to the user and asking him/her to re-enter a password in a webpage to confirm it. 1. Fake E-Mails:  The attacker sends fake E-Mails (see Box 2.7) to users in such that the user finds it as a real e-mail.  This activity is also called “Phishing”.  It is an attempt to attract the Internet users (netizens) to reveal their personal information, such as usernames, passwords and credit card details by impersonating as a trustworthy and legitimate organization or an individual.  Banks, financial institutes and payment gateways",

Fake E-Mails:  The attacker sends fake E-Mails (see Box 2.7) to users in such that the user finds it as a real e-mail.  This activity is also called “Phishing”.  It is an attempt to attract the Internet users (netizens) to reveal their personal information, such as usernames, passwords and credit card details by impersonating as a trustworthy and legitimate organization or an individual.  Banks, financial institutes and payment gateways are the common targets.  Phishing is typically carried out through E-Mails or instant messaging and often directs users to enter details at a website, usually designed by the attacker with abiding the look and feel of the original website.  Thus, Phishing is also an example of social engineering techniques used to fool netizens.  The term “Phishing” has been evolved from the analogy that Internet scammers are using E-Mails attract to fish for passwords and financial data from the sea of Internet users (i.e., netizens).  The term was coined in 1996 by hackers who were stealing AOL Internet accounts by scamming passwords without the knowledge of AOL users.  As hackers have a tendency of replacing “f” with “ph,” the term “Phishing” came into being. 2. E-Mail attachments:  E-Mail attachments are used to send malicious code to a victim’s system, which will automatically (e.g., keylogger utility to capture passwords) get executed.  Viruses, Trojans, and worms can be included cleverly into the attachments to entice a victim to open the attachment. 3. Pop-up windows:  Pop-up windows are also used, in a similar manner to E-Mail attachments. Pop-up windows with special offers or free stuff can encourage a user to unintentionally install malicious software. 2.4 Cyberstalking  The dictionary meaning of “stalking” is an “act or process of following prey stealthily – trying to approach somebody or something.”  Cyberstalking has been defined as the use of information and communications technology, particularly the Internet, by an individual or group of individuals to harass another individual, group of individuals, or organization.  The behavior includes false accusations, monitoring, transmission of threats, ID theft, damage to data or equipment, solicitation of minors for sexual purposes, and gathering information for harassment purposes.  Cyberstalking refers to the use of Internet and/or other electronic communications devices to stalk another person.  It involves harassing or threatening behavior that an individual will conduct repeatedly, for example, following a person, visiting a person’s home and/or at business place, making phone calls, leaving written messages, or vandalizing against the person’s property. As the Internet has become an integral part of our personal and professional lives, cyberstalkers take advantage of ease of communication and an increased access topersonal information available with a few mouse clicks or keystrokes. 2.4.1 Types of Stalkers There are primarily two types of",

As the Internet has become an integral part of our personal and professional lives, cyberstalkers take advantage of ease of communication and an increased access topersonal information available with a few mouse clicks or keystrokes. 2.4.1 Types of Stalkers There are primarily two types of stalkers. 1. Online stalkers:  They aim to start the interaction with the victim directly with the help of the Internet.  E-Mail and chat rooms are the most popular communication medium to get connected with the victim, rather than using traditional instrumentation like telephone/cell phone.  The stalker makes sure that the victim recognizes the attack attempted on him/her.  The stalker can make use of a third party to harass the victim. 2. Offline stalkers:  The stalker may begin the attack using traditional methods such as following the victim, watching the daily routine of the victim, etc.  Searching on message boards/newsgroups, personal websites, and people finding services or websites are most common ways to gather information about the victim using the Internet.  The victim is not aware that the Internet has been used to perpetuate an attack against them. 2.4.2 Cases Reported on Cyberstalking  The majority of cyberstalkers are men and the majority of their victims are women.  Some cases also have been reported where women act as cyberstalkers and men as the victims as well as cases of same-sex cyberstalking.  In many cases, the cyberstalker and the victim hold a prior relationship, and the cyberstalking begins when the victim attempts to break off the relationship, for example, ex-lover, ex-spouse, boss/subordinate, and neighbor.  However, there also have been many instances of cyberstalking by strangers. 2.4.3 How Stalking Works? It is seen that stalking works in the following ways: 1. Personal information gathering about the victim: Name; family background; contact details such as cell phone and telephone numbers (of residence as well as office); address of residence as well as of the office; E-Mail address; date of birth, etc. 2. Establish a contact with victim through telephone/cell phone. Once the contact is established, the stalker may make calls to the victim to threaten/harass. 3. Stalkers will almost always establish a contact with the victims through E-Mail. The letters may have the tone of loving, threatening or can be sexually explicit. The stalker may use multiple names while contacting the victim. 4. Some stalkers keep on sending repeated E-Mails asking for various kinds of favors or threaten the victim. 5. The stalker may post the victim’s personal information on any website related to illicit services such as sex-workers’ services or dating services, posing as if the victim has posted the information and invite the people to call the victim on the given contact",

The stalker will use bad and/or offensive/attractive language to invite the interested persons. 6. Whosoever comes across the information, start calling the victim on the given contact details ( telephone/cell phone nos), asking for sexual services or relationships. 7. Some stalkers subscribe/register the E-Mail account of the victim to innumerable pornographic and sex sites, because of which victim will start receiving such kind of unsolicited E-Mails. 2.4.4 Real-Life Incident of Cyberstalking Case Study The Indian police have registered first case of cyberstalking in Delhi – the brief account of the case has been mentioned here. To maintain confidentiality and privacy of the entities involved, we have changed their names.  Mrs. Joshi received almost 40 calls in 3 days mostly at odd hours from as far away as Kuwait, Cochin, Bombay, and Ahmadabad.  The said calls created havoc in the personal life destroying mental peace of Mrs. Joshi who decided to register a complaint with Delhi Police.  A person was using her ID to chat over the Internet at the website www.mirc.com, mostly in the Delhi channel for four consecutive days.  This person was chatting on the Internet, using her name and giving her address, talking in obscene language.  The same person was also deliberately giving her telephone number to other chatters encouraging them to call Mrs. Joshi at odd hours.  This was the first time when a case of cyberstalking was registered.  Cyberstalking does not have a standard definition but it can be defined to mean threatening, unwarranted behavior, or advances directed by one person toward another person using Internet and other forms of online communication channels as medium. Box 2.8 | Cyberbullying The National Crime Prevention Council defi nes Cyberbullying as “when the Internet, cell phones or other devices are used to send or post text or images intended to hurt or embarrass another person.” www. StopCyberbullying.org, an expert organization dedicated to Internet safety, security, and privacy defi nes cyberbullying as “a situation when a child, tween, or teen is repeatedly ‘tormented, threatened, harassed, humiliated, embarrassed, or otherwise targeted’ by another child, tween, or teen using text messaging, E-Mail, instant messaging, or any other type of digital technology.” The practice of cyberbullying is not limited to children and, while the behavior is identified by the same definition in adults, the distinction in age groups is referred to as cyberstalking or cyberharassment when perpetrated by adults toward adults.

Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber-bullying (2 April 2009). 2.5 Cybercafe and Cybercrimes  In February 2009, Nielsen survey on the profile of cybercafes users in India, it was found that 90% of the audience, across eight cities and 3,500 cafes, were male and in the age group of 15–35 years; 52% were graduates and postgraduates, though almost over 50% were students.  Hence, it is extremely important to understand the IT security and governance practiced in the cybercafes.  In the past several years, many instances have been reported in India, where cybercafes are known to be used for either real or false terrorist communication.  Cybercrimes such as stealing of bank passwords and subsequent fraudulent withdrawal of money have also happened through cybercafes.  Cybercafes have also been used regularly for sending obscene mails to harass people.  Public computers, usually referred to the systems, available in cybercafes, hold two types of risks.  First, we do not know what programs are installed on the computer – that is, risk of malicious programs such as keyloggers or Spyware, which maybe running at the background that can capture the keystrokes to know the passwords and other confidential information and/or monitor the browsing behavior.  Second, over-the-shoulder surfing can enable others to find out your passwords. Therefore, one has to be extremely careful about protecting his/her privacy on such systems, as one does not know who will use the computer after him/her.  Indian Information Technology Act (ITA) 2000, does not define cybercafes and interprets cybercafes as “network service providers” referred to under the Section 79, which imposed on them a responsibility for “due diligence” failing which they would be liable for the offenses committed in their network.  Cybercriminals prefer cybercafes to carry out their activities.  The criminals tend to identify one particular personal computer (PC) to prepare it for their use.  Cybercriminals can either install malicious programs such as keyloggers and/or Spyware or launch an attack on the target.  Cybercriminals will visit these cafes at a particular time and on the prescribed frequency, maybe alternate day or twice a week.  A recent survey conducted in one of the metropolitan cities in India reveals the following facts: 1. Pirated software(s) such as OS, browser, office automation software(s) (e.g., Microsoft Office) are installed in all the computers. 2. Antivirus software is found to be not updated to the latest patch and/or antivirus signature. 3. Several cybercafes had installed the software called “Deep Freeze” for protecting the computers from prospective malware attacks. Deep Freeze can wipe out the details of all activities carried out on the computer when one clicks on the “restart” button. Such practices present challenges to the police or crime investigators when they visit the cybercafes to pick up clues after the Interet Service",

Annual maintenance contract (AMC) found to be not in a place for servicing the computers; hence, hard disks for all the computers are not formatted unless the computer is down. Not having the AMC is a risk from cybercrime perspective because a cybercriminal can install a Malicious Code on a computer and conduct criminal activities without any interruption. 5. Pornographic websites and other similar websites with indecent contents are not blocked. 6. Cybercafe owners have very less awareness about IT Security and IT Governance. 7. Government/ISPs/State Police (cyber cell wing) do not seem to provide IT Governance guidelines to cybercafe owners. 8. Cybercafe association or State Police (cyber cell wing) do not seem to conduct periodic visits to cybercafes – one of the cybercafe owners whom we interviewed expressed a view that the police will not visit a cybercafe unless criminal activity is registered by filing an First Information Report (FIR). Cybercafe owners feel that police either have a very little knowledge about the technical aspects involved in cybercrimes and/or about conceptual understanding of IT security. There are thousands of cybercafes across India. In the event that a central agency takes up the responsibility for monitoring cybercafes, an individual should take care while visiting and/or operating from cybercafe. Here are a few tips for safety and security while using the computer in a cybercafe: 1. Always logout: 2. Stay with the computer: 3. Clear history and temporary files: 4. Be alert: 5.

The invariably low cost of maintaining a Botnet and the ever diminishing degree of knowledge required to manage one are conducive to the growth in popularity and, consequently, the number of Botnets.  If someone wants to start a “business” and has no programming skills, there are plenty of “Bot for sale” offers on forums.  ‘encryption of these programs’ code can also be ordered in the same way to protect them from detection by antivirus tools.  Another option is to steal an existing Botnet. Figure 2.8 explains how Botnets create business.  One can reduce the chances of becoming part of a Bot by limiting access into the system.  Leaving your Internet connection ON and unprotected is just like leaving the front door of the house wide open. One can ensure following to secure the system: 1. Use antivirus and anti-Spyware software and keep it up-to-date: 2. Set the OS to download and install security patches automatically: 3. Use a firewall to protect the system from hacking attacks while it is connected on the Internet: A firewall is a software and/or hardware that is designed to block unauthorized access while permitting authorized communications. 4.

DDoS: Distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS) occurs when multiple systems flood the bandwidth or resources of a targeted system, usually one or more web servers. These systems are compromised by attackers using a variety of methods. 2.7 Attack Vector  An “attack vector” is a path, which an attacker can gain access to a computer or to a network server to deliver a payload or malicious outcome.  Attack vectors enable attackers to exploit system vulnerabilities, including the human element.  Attack vectors include viruses, E-Mail attachments, webpages, pop-up windows, instant messages, chat rooms, and deception. All of these methods involve programming (or, in a few cases, hardware), except deception, in which a human operator is fooled into removing or weakening system defenses.  To some extent, firewalls and antivirus software can block attack vectors.  However, no protection method is totally attack-proof.  A defense method that is effective today may not remain so for long because attackers are constantly updating attack vectors, and seeking new ones, in their quest to gain unauthorized access to computers and servers. Refer to Box 2.10.  The most common malicious payloads are viruses (which can function as their own attack vectors), Trojan Horses, worms, and Spyware.  If an attack vector is thought of as a guided missile, its payload can be compared to the warhead in the tip of the missile.  In the technical terms, payload is the necessary data being carried within a packet or other transmission unit – in this scenario (i.e., attack vector) payload means the malicious activity that the attack performs.  From the technical perspective, payload does not include the “overhead” data required to get the packet to its destination. Payload may depend on the following point of view: “What constitutes it?” To a communications layer that needs some of the overhead data to do its job, the payload is sometimes considered to include that part of the overhead data that this layer handles. The attack vectors described here are how most of them are launched. 1. Attack by E-Mail: The content is either embedded in the message or linked to by the message. Sometimes attacks combine the two vectors, so that if the message does not get you, the attachment will. Spam is almost always carrier for scams, fraud, dirty tricks, or malicious action of some kind. Any link that offers something “free” or tempting is a suspect. 2. Attachments (and other files): Malicious attachments install malicious computer code. The code could be a virus, Trojan Horse, Spyware, or any other kind of malware. Attachments attempt to install their payload as soon as you open them. 3. Attack by deception: Deception is",

    "text": "new ones, in their quest to gain unauthorized access to computers and servers. Refer to Box 2.10.  The most common malicious payloads are viruses (which can function as their own attack vectors), Trojan Horses, worms, and Spyware.  If an attack vector is thought of as a guided missile, its payload can be compared to the warhead in the tip of the missile.  In the technical terms, payload is the necessary data being carried within a packet or other transmission unit – in this scenario (i.e., attack vector) payload means the malicious activity that the attack performs.  From the technical perspective, payload does not include the “overhead” data required to get the packet to its destination. Payload may depend on the following point of view: “What constitutes it?” To a communications layer that needs some of the overhead data to do its job, the payload is sometimes considered to include that part of the overhead data that this layer handles. The attack vectors described here are how most of them are launched. 1. Attack by E-Mail: The content is either embedded in the message or linked to by the message. Sometimes attacks combine the two vectors, so that if the message does not get you, the attachment will. Spam is almost always carrier for scams, fraud, dirty tricks, or malicious action of some kind. Any link that offers something “free” or tempting is a suspect. 2. Attachments (and other files): Malicious attachments install malicious computer code. The code could be a virus, Trojan Horse, Spyware, or any other kind of malware. Attachments attempt to install their payload as soon as you open them. 3. Attack by deception: Deception is aimed at the user/operator as a vulnerable entry point. It is not just malicious computer code that one needs to monitor. Fraud, scams, and to some extent Spam, not to mention viruses, worms and such require the unwitting cooperation of the computer’s operator to succeed. Social engineering are other forms of deception that are often an attack vector too. 4. Hackers: Hackers/crackers are a formidable attack vector because, unlike ordinary Malicious Code, people are flexible and they can improvise. Hackers/crackers use variety of hacking tools, heuristics, Cyberoffenses: How and social engineering to gain access to computers and online accounts. They often install a Trojan Horse to commandeer the computer for their own use. 5. Heedless guests (attack by webpage): Counterfeit websites are used to extract personal information. Such websites look very much like the genuine websites they imitate. One may think he/she is doing business with someone you trust. However, he/she is really giving their personal information, like address, credit card number, and expiration date. They are often used in conjunction with Spam, which gets you there in the first place. Pop- up webpages may install Spyware, Adware or Trojans. 6. Attack of the worms: Many worms are delivered as E-Mail attachments, but network worms use holes in network protocols directly. Any remote access service, like file sharing, is likely to be vulnerable to this sort of worm. In most cases, a firewall will block system worms. Many of these system worms install Trojan Horses. 7. Malicious macros: Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel are some of the examples that allow macros. A macro does something like automating a spreadsheet, for example. Macros can also be used for malicious purposes. All Internet services like instant messaging, Internet Relay Chart(IRC), and P2P fi le-sharing networks rely on cozy connections between the computer and the other computers on the Internet. If one is using P2P software then his/her system is more vulnerable to hostile exploits. 8. Foistware (sneakware): Foistware is the software that adds hidden components to the system with cunning nature. Spyware is the most common form of foistware. Foistware is partial- legal software bundled with some attractive software. Sneak software often hijacks your browser and diverts you to some “revenue opportunity” that the foistware has set up. 9. Viruses: These are malicious computer codes that hitch a ride and make the payload. Nowadays, virus vectors include E-Mail attachments, downloaded files, worms, etc. Box 2.10 | Zero-Day Attack A zero-day (or zero-hour) attack[17] is a computer threat which attempts to exploit computer application vulnerabilities that are unknown to anybody in the world (i.e., undisclosed to the software vendor and software users) and/or for which no patch (i.e., security fi x) is available. Zero-day exploits are used or shared by attackers before the software vendor knows about the vulnerability. Sometimes software vendors discover the vulnerability but developing a patch can take time. Alternatively, software vendors can also hold releasing the patch reason to avoid",

Zero-day exploits are used or shared by attackers before the software vendor knows about the vulnerability. Sometimes software vendors discover the vulnerability but developing a patch can take time. Alternatively, software vendors can also hold releasing the patch reason to avoid the flooding the customers with numerous individual updates. A “zero-day” attack is launched just on or before the first or “zeroth” day of vendor awareness, reason being the vendor should not get any opportunity to communicate/distribute a security fix to users of such software. If the vulnerability is not particularly dangerous, software vendors prefer to hold until multiple updates (i.e., security fixes commonly known as patches) are collected and then release them together as a package. Malware writers are able to exploit zero-day vulnerabilities through several different attack vectors. Zero-day emergency response team (ZERT): This is a group of software engineers who work to release non-vendor patches for zero-day exploits. Nevada is attempting to provide support with the Zeroday Project at www.zerodayproject.com, which purports to provide information on upcoming attacks and provide support to vulnerable systems. Also, visit the weblink http://www.isotf.org/zert to get more information about it. 2.8 Cloud Computing  The growing popularity of cloud computing and virtualization among organizations have made it possible, the next target of cybercriminals.  Cloud computing services, while offering considerable benefits and cost savings, move servers outside the organizations security perimeter, which make it easier for cybercriminals to attack these systems.  Cloud computing is Internet (“cloud”)-based development and use of computer technology (“computing”).  The term cloud is used as a metaphor for the Internet, based on the cloud drawing used to depict the Internet in computer networks.  Cloud computing is a term used for hosted services delivered over the Internet.  A cloud service has three distinct characteristics which differentiate it from traditional hosting: 1. It is sold on demand – typically by the minute or the hour; 2. It is elastic in terms of usage – a user can have as much or as little of a service as he/she wants at any given time; 3. The service is fully managed by the provider – a user just needs PC and Internet connection. Significant innovations into distributed computing and virtualization as well as improved access speed over the Internet have generated a great demand for cloud computing. 2.8.1 Why Cloud Computing? The cloud computing has following advantages. 1. Applications and data can be accessed from anywhere at any time. Data may not be held on a hard drive on one user’s computer. 2. It could bring hardware costs down. One would need the Internet connection. 3. Organizations do not have to buy a set of software or software licenses for every employee and the organizations could pay a metered fee to a cloud computing company. 4.

Organizations do not have to buy a set of software or software licenses for every employee and the organizations could pay a metered fee to a cloud computing company. 4. Organizations do not have to rent a physical space to store servers and databases. Servers and digital storage devices take up space. Cloud computing gives the option of storing data on someone else’s hardware, thereby removing the need for physical space on the front end. 5. Organizations would be able to save money on IT support because organizations will have to ensure about the desktop (i.e., a client) and continuous Internet connectivity instead of servers and other hardware. The cloud computing services can be either private or public. 2.8.2 Types of Services Services provided by cloud computing are as follows: 1. Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS): It is like Amazon Web Services that provide virtual servers with unique IP addresses and blocks of storage on demand. Customers benefit from an Application Programmable Interface (API) from which they can control their servers. As customers can pay for exactly the amount of service they use, like for electricity or water, this service is also called utility computing. 2. Platform-as-a-service (PaaS): It is a set of software and development tools hosted on the provider’s servers. Developers can create applications using the provider’s APIs. Google Apps is one of the most famous PaaS providers. Developers should take notice that there are not any interoperability standards; therefore, some providers may not allow you to take your application and put it on another platform. 3. Software-as-a-service (SaaS): It is the broadest market. In this case, the provider allows the customer only to use its applications. The software interacts with the user through a user interface. These applications can be anything from Web-based E-Mail to applications such as Twitter or Last.fm. 2.8.3 Cybercrime and Cloud Computing  Nowadays, prime area of the risk in cloud computing is protection of user data. Although cloud computing is an emerging field, the idea has been evolved over few years.  Risks associated with cloud computing environment are as follows 1. Elevated user access-Any data processed outside the organization brings with it an inherent level of risk 2. Regulatory compliance-Cloud computing service providers are not able and/or not willing to undergo external assessments. 3. Location of the data-User doesn’t know where",

Initial uncovering:  Two steps are involved here. i. In the first step called as reconnaissance, the attacker gathers information about the target on the Internet websites. ii. In the second step, the attacker finds the company’s internal network, such as, Internet domain, machine names and the company’s Internet Protocol (IP) address ranges to steal the data. 2. Network probe (investigation):  At the network probe stage, the attacker scans the organization information through a “ping sweep” of the network IP addresses.  Then a “port scanning” tool is used to discover exactly which services are running on the target system.  At this point, the attacker has still not done anything that would be considered as an abnormal activity on the network or anything that can be classified as an intrusion. 3. Crossing the line toward electronic crime (E-crime):  Once the attackers are able to access a user account, then they will attempt further exploits to get an administrator or “root” access.  Root access is a UNIX term and is associated with the system privileges required to run all services and access all files on the system (readers are expected to have a basic familiarity with Unix-based systems).  “Root” is an administrator or super-user access and grants them the privileges to do anything on the system. 4.

Jyothi R, A ssistant Professor, Dept.of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) Page 1  The next step is to remove any evidence of the attack. The attacker will usually install a set of tools that replace existing files and services with Trojan files and services that have a backdoor password. 5. Grab the data:  Now that the attacker has “captured the network,” he/she takes advantage of his/her position to steal confidential data 6. Covering tracks:  This is the last step in any cyber attack, which refers to the activities undertaken by the attacker to extend misuse of the system without being detected.  The attacker can remain undetected for long",

Proxy Servers and Anonymizers Proxy server is a computer on a network which acts as an intermediary for connection with other computers on that network.  The attacker first connects to a proxy server and establishes a connection with the target system through existing connection with proxy.  This enables an attacker to surf on the Web anonymously and/or hide the attack.  A client connects to the proxy server and requests some services (such as a file, webpage) available from a different server.  The proxy server evaluates the request and provides the resource by establishing the connection to the respective server and/or requests the required service on behalf of the client.  Using a proxy server can allow an attacker to hide ID (i.e., become anonymous on the network). A proxy server has following purposes: 1. Keep the systems behind the curtain (mainly for security reasons). 2. Speed up access to a resource (through “caching”). It is usually used to cache the web pages from a web server. 3. Specialized proxy servers are used to filter unwanted content such as advertisements. 4.

Phishing “Phishing” refers to an attack using mail programs to deceive Internet users into disclosing confidential information that can be then exploited for illegal purposes.  While checking electronic mail (E-Mail) one day a user finds a message from the bank threatening to close the bank account if he/she does not reply immediately.  Although the message seems to be suspicious from the contents of the message, it is difficult to conclude that it is a fake/false E-Mail.  This message and other such messages are examples of Phishing – in addition to stealing personal and financial data – and can infect systems with viruses and also a method of online ID theft in various cases.  These messages look authentic and attempt to get users to reveal their personal information.  It is believed that Phishing is an alternative spelling of “fishing,” as in “to fish for information.”  The first documented use of the word “Phishing” was in 1996. How Phishing Works? Phishers work in the following ways: 1. Planning: Criminals, usually called as phishers, decide the target. 2. Setup: Once phishers know which business/business house to spoof and who their victims. 3. Attack: the phisher sends a phony message that appears to be from a reputable source. 4.

Password Cracking  Password is like a key to get an entry into computerized systems like a lock.  Password cracking is a process of recovering passwords from data that have been stored in or transmitted by a computer system.  Usually, an attacker follows a common approach – repeatedly making guesses for the password. The purpose of password cracking is as follows: 1. To recover a forgotten password. 2. As a preventive measure by system administrators to check for easily crackable passwords. 3. To gain unauthorized access to a system. Manual password cracking is to attempt to logon with different passwords. The attacker follows the following steps: 1. Find a valid user account such as an Administrator or Guest; 2. create a list of possible passwords; 3. rank the passwords from high to low probability; 4. key-in each password; 5. try again until a successful password is found. Passwords can be guessed sometimes with knowledge of the user’s personal information. Examples of guessable passwords include: 1. Blank (none); 2. the words like “password,” “passcode” and “admin”; 3. series of letters from the “QWERTY” keyboard, for example, qwerty, asdf or qwertyuiop; 4. user’s name or login name; Jyothi R, A ssistant Professor, Dept.of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) Page 4 5. name of user’s friend/relative/pet; 6. user’s birthplace or date of birth, or a relative’s or a friend’s; 7. user’s vehicle number, office number, residence number or mobile number; 8. name of a celebrity who is considered to be an idol (e.g., actors, actress, spiritual gurus) by the user;  An attacker can also create a script file (i.e., automated program) which will be executed to try each password in a list.  This is still considered manual cracking, is time-consuming and not usually effective.  Passwords are stored in a database and password verification process is established into the system when a user attempts to",

If they match, user gains the access; this process is called authentication. The most commonly used hash functions can be computed rapidly and the attacker can test these hashes with the help of passwords cracking tools (see Table 4.3) to get the plain text password. Password cracking attacks can be classified under three categories as follows: 1. Online attacks; 2. offline attacks; 3. non-electronic attacks (e.g., social engineering, shoulder surfing and dumpster diving). Online Attacks  An attacker can create a script file that will be executed to try each password in a list and when matches, an attacker can gain the access to the system.  The most popular online attack is man-in-the middle (MITM) attack, also termed as “bucket- brigade attack” or sometimes “Janus attack.”  It is a form of active stealing in which the attacker establishes a connection between a Jyothi R, A ssistant Professor, Dept.of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) Page 5 victim and the server to which a victim is connected.  When a victim client connects to the fraudulent server, the MITM server intercepts the call, hashes the password and passes the connection to the victim server (e.g., an attacker within reception range of an unencrypted Wi-Fi wireless access point can insert himself as a man- in- the-middle).  This type of attack is used to obtain the passwords for E-Mail accounts on public websites such as Yahoo, Hotmail and Gmail and can also used to get the passwords for",

Offline Attacks  Mostly offline attacks are performed from a location other than the target (i.e., either a computer system or while on the network) where these passwords reside or are used.  Offline attacks usually require physical access to the computer and copying the password file from the system onto removable media. Password guidelines. 1. Passwords used for business E-Mail accounts, personal E-Mail accounts and banking/financial user accounts should be kept separate. 2. Passwords should be of minimum eight alphanumeric characters (common names or phrases should be phrased). 3. Passwords should be changed every 30/45 days. 4. Passwords should not be shared with relatives and/or friends. 5. Password used previously should not be used while renewing the password. 6. Passwords of personal E-Mail accounts and banking/financial user accounts should be changed from a secured system, within couple of days, if these E-Mail accounts has been accessed from public Internet facilities such as cybercafes/hotels/libraries. 7. Passwords should not be stored under mobile phones/PDAs, as these devices are also prone to cyberattacks. 8.

It can be classified as software keylogger and hardware keylogger. Software Keyloggers  Software keyloggers are software programs installed on the computer systems which usually are located between the OS and the keyboard hardware, and every keystroke is recorded.  Software keyloggers are installed on a computer system by Trojans or viruses without the knowledge of the user.  Cybercriminals always install such tools on the insecure computer systems available in public places (i.e., cybercafés, etc) and can obtain the required information about the victim very easily.  A keylogger usually consists of two files that get installed in the same directory: a dynamic link library (DLL) file and an EXEcutable (EXE) file that installs the DLL file and triggers it to work. DLL does all the recording of keystrokes. Some Important Keyloggers are as follows All In One Keylogger Stealth Keylogger Perfect Keylogger KGB Spy Spy Buddy Elite Keylogger CyberSpy Powered Keylogger Hardware Keyloggers  Hardware keyloggers are small hardware devices.  These are connected to the PC and/or to the keyboard and save every keystroke into a file or in the memory of the hardware device.  Cybercriminals install such devices on ATM machines to capture ATM Cards’ PINs.  Each keypress on the keyboard of the ATM gets registered by these keyloggers.  These keyloggers look like an integrated part of such systems; hence, bank customers are unaware of their presence.

(Visit http://www.anti-keyloggers.com for more information) Advantages of using antikeylogger are as follows: 1. Firewalls cannot detect the installations of keyloggers on the systems; hence, antikeyloggers can detect installations of keylogger. 2.

Keystroke loggers: Virus and Worms  Computer virus is a program that can “infect” legitimate programs by modifying them to include a possibly “evolved” copy of itself.  Viruses spread themselves, without the knowledge or permission of the users, to potentially large numbers of programs on many machines.  A computer virus passes from computer to computer in a similar manner as a biological virus passes from person to person.  Viruses may also contain malicious instructions that may cause damage or annoyance; the combination of possibly Malicious Code with the ability to spread is what makes viruses a considerable concern.  Viruses can often spread without any readily visible symptoms.  A virus can start on event-driven effects (e.g., triggered after a specific number of executions), time-driven effects (e.g., triggered on a specific date, such as Friday the 13th) or can occur at random. Viruses can take some typical actions: 1. Display a message to prompt an action which may set of the virus; Jyothi R, A ssistant Professor, Dept.of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) Page 9 2. delete files inside the system into which viruses enter; 3. scramble data on a hard",

Program viruses: These viruses become active when the program file (usually with extensions .bin, .com,.exe, .ovl, .drv) is excuted 3. Multipartite viruses: It is a hybrid of a boot sector and program viruses. It infects program files along with the boot record when the infected program is active. 4. Stealth viruses: It hides itself and so detecting this type of virus is very difficult. It can hiding itself such a way that antivirus software also cannot detect it. Example for Stealth virus is “Brain Virus”. 5. Polymorphic viruses: It acts like a “chameleon” that changes its virus signature (i.e., binary pattern) every time it spreads through the system (i.e., multiplies and infects a new file). Hence, it is always difficult to detect polymorphic virus with the help of an antivirus program. 6. Macro viruses: Many applications, such as Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel, support MACROs (i.e., macrolanguages). These macros are programmed as a macro embedded in a document. Once macrovirus gets onto a victim’s computer then every document he/she produces will become infected. 7.

Some typical examples of threats by Trojans are as follows: 1. They erase, overwrite or corrupt data on a computer. 2. They help to spread other malware such as viruses (by a dropper Trojan). 3. They deactivate or interfere with antivirus and firewall programs. 4. They allow remote access to your computer (by a remote access Trojan). 5.

Backdoor  A backdoor is a means of access to a computer program that bypasses security mechanisms. A programmer may sometimes install a backdoor so that the program can be accessed for troubleshooting or other purposes.  However, attackers often use backdoors that they detect or install themselves as part of an exploit.  In some cases, a worm is designed to take advantage of a backdoor created by an earlier attack.  A backdoor works in background and hides from the user.  It is very similar to a virus and, therefore, is quite difficult to detect and completely disable.  A backdoor is one of the most dangerous parasite, as it allows a malicious person to perform any possible action on a compromised system. Following are some functions of backdoor: 1. It allows an attacker to create, delete, rename, copy or edit any file, execute various commands; change any system settings; alter the Windows registry; run, control and terminate applications; install arbitrary software and parasites. 2. It allows an attacker to control computer hardware devices, modify related settings, shutdown or restart a computer without asking for user permission. 3. It steals sensitive personal information, valuable documents, passwords, login names, ID details; logs user activity and tracks web browsing habits. Jyothi R, A ssistant Professor, Dept.of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) Page 14 4. It records keystrokes that a user types on a computer’s keyboard and captures screenshots. 5.

The word steganography combines the Greek words steganos , meaning \"covered, concealed, or protected\", and graphein meaning \"writing\".  It is a method that attempts to hide the existence of a message or communication.  Steganography is always misunderstood with cryptography  The different names for steganography are data hiding, information hiding and digital watermarking.  Steganography can be used to make a digital watermark to detect illegal copying of digital images. Thus, it aids confidentiality and integrity of the data.  Digital watermarking is the process of possibly irreversibly embedding information into a digital signal.  The Digital signal may be, for example, audio, pictures or video. Jyothi R, A ssistant Professor, Dept.of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) Page 15  If the signal is copied then the information is also carried in the copy.  In other words, when steganography is used to place a hidden “trademark” in images, music and software, the result is a technique referred to as “watermarking” Steganalysis  Steganalysis is the art and science of detecting messages that are hidden in images, audio/video files using steganography.  The goal of steganalysis is to identify suspected packages and to determine whether or not they have a payload encoded into them, and if possible recover it.  Automated tools are",

It is said that terrorists use where the existence steganography techniques to hide their communication in images on the Internet; most popular images are used such as those of film actresses or other celebrities. In its basic form, steganography is simple. DoS and DDoS Attacks A denial-of-service attack (DoS attack) or distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS attack) is an attempt to make a computer resource (i.e., information systems) unavailable to its intended users. DoS Attacks  In this type of criminal act, the attacker floods the bandwidth of the victim’s network or fills his E-Mail box with Spam mail depriving him of the services he is entitled to access or provide.  The attackers typically target sites or services hosted on high-profile web servers such as banks, credit card payment gateways, mobile phone networks and even root name servers. Jyothi R, A ssistant Professor, Dept.of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) Page 16  Buffer overflow technique is employed to commit such kind of criminal attack known as Spoofing.  The term IP address Spoofing refers to the creation of IP packets with a forged (spoofed) source IP address with the purpose of concealing the ID of the sender or impersonating another computing system.  A packet is a formatted unit of data carried by a packet mode computer network.  The attacker spoofs the IP address and floods the network of the victim with repeated requests.  As the IP address is",

Unusually slow network performance (opening fi les or accessing websites); 2. unavailability of a particular website; 3. inability to access any website; 4. dramatic increase in the number of Spam E-Mails received (this type of DoS attack is termed as an E-Mail bomb). The goal of DoS is not to gain unauthorized access to systems or data, but to prevent intended users (i.e., legitimate users) of a service from using it. A DoS attack may do the following: 1. Flood a network with traffic, thereby preventing legitimate network traffic. 2. Disrupt connections between two systems, thereby preventing access to a service. 3. Prevent a particular individual from accessing a service. 4. Disrupt service to a specific system or person. Classification of DoS Attacks 1.

Types or Levels of DoS Attacks There are several types or levels of DoS attacks as follows: 1. Flood attack: This is the earliest form of DoS attack and is also known as ping food. It is based on an attacker simply sending the victim overwhelming number of ping packets, usually by using the “ping” command, which result into more traffic than the victim can handle. 2. Ping of death attack: The ping of death attack sends oversized Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packets, and it is one of the core protocols of the IP Suite. It is mainly used by networked computers’ OSs to send error messages indicating (e.g., that a requested service is not available or that a host or router could not be reached) datagrams (encapsulated in IP packets) to the victim. 3. SYN attack: It is also termed as TCP SYN Flooding. In the TCP, handshaking of network connections is done with SYN and ACK messages.  An attacker initiates a TCP connection to the server with an SYN.  The server replies with an SYN-ACK.  The client then does not send back an ACK, causing the server to allocate memory for the pending connection and wait.  This fills up the buffer space for SYN messages on the target system, preventing other systems on the network from communicating with the target system. 4. Teardrop attack: The teardrop attack is an attack where fragmented packets are forged to overlap each other when the receiving host tries to reassemble them. IP’s packet fragmentation algorithm is used to send corrupted packets to confuse the victim Jyothi R, A ssistant Professor, Dept.of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) Page 18 and may hang the system. This attack can crash various OSs due to a bug in their TCP/IP fragmentation reassembly code. 5. Smurf attack: This is a type of DoS attack that floods a target system via spoofed broadcast ping messages. This attack consists of a host sending an echo request (ping) to a network broadcast address. 6.

Jolt2 : The vulnerability allows remote attackers to cause a DoS attack against Windows- based machines – the attack causes the target machine to consume of the CPU time on processing of illegal packets. 2. Nemesy : This program generates random packets of spoofed source IP to enable the attacker to launch DoS attack. 3. Targa : It is a program that can be used to run eight different DoS attacks. The attacker has the option to launch either individual attacks or try all the attacks until one is successful. 4. Crazy Pinger : This tool could send large packets of ICMP(Internet Control Message Protocol) to a remote target network. 5. SomeTrouble: It is a remote flooder and bomber. It is developed in Delphi. DDoS Attacks  In a DDoS attack, an attacker may use your computer to attack another computer.  By taking advantage of security vulnerabilities or weaknesses, an attacker could take control of your computer.  He/she could then force your computer to send huge amounts of data to a website or send Spam to particular E-Mail addresses.  The attack is “distributed” because the attacker is using multiple computers, including yours, to launch the DoS attack.  A DDoS attack is a distributed DoS wherein a large number of zombie systems are synchronized to attack a particular system. Jyothi R, A ssistant Professor, Dept.of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) Page 19  The zombie systems are called “secondary victims” and the main target is called “primary victim.”  Malware can carry DDoS attack mechanisms – one of the better-known examples of this is MyDoom.  Botnet is the popular medium to launch DoS/DDoS attacks.  Attackers can also break into systems using automated tools that exploit flaws in programs that listen for connections from remote hosts.

How to Protect from DoS/DDoS Attacks Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center (CERT/CC) offers many preventive measures from being a victim of DoS attack. 1. Implement router filters. This will lessen your exposure to certain DoS attacks. 2. If such filters are available for your system, install patches to guard against TCP SYN flooding. 3. Disable any unused or inessential network service. 4. Enable quota systems on your OS if they are available. 5. Observe your system’s performance and establish baselines for ordinary activity. 6. Routinely examine your physical security with regard to your current needs. 7. Use Tripwire or a similar tool to detect changes in configuration information or other files. 8. Invest in and maintain “hot spares” – machines that can be placed into service quickly if a similar machine is disabled. 9. Invest in redundant and fault-tolerant network configurations. 10. Establish and maintain regular backup schedules 11. Establish and maintain appropriate password policies Attacks on Wireless Networks  Wireless technologies have become increasingly popular in day-to-day business and personal lives.  Hand-held devices such as the PDAs allow individuals to access calendars, E-Mail addresses, phone number lists and the Internet.  Wireless networks extend the range of traditional wired networks by using radio waves to Jyothi R, A ssistant Professor, Dept.of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) Page 20 transmit data to wireless-enabled devices such as laptops and PDAs.  Wireless networks are generally composed of two basic elements o access points (APs) and o other wireless-enabled devices, such as laptops radio transmitters and receivers to communicate or “connect” with each other.  APs are connected through physical wiring to a conventional network, and they broadcast signals with which a wireless",

Wireless Networks The following are different types of “mobile workers”: 1. Tethered/remote worker: This is considered to be an employee who generally remains at a single point of work, but is remote to the central company systems. 2. Roaming user: This is either an employee who works in an environment (e.g., warehousing, shop floor, etc.) or in multiple areas (e.g., meeting rooms). 3. Nomad: This category covers employees requiring solutions in semi-tethered (connected) environments where modem use frequently. 4.

Access points: It is also termed as AP. It is a hardware device and/or software that act as a central transmitter and receiver of WLAN radio signals. Users of wireless device, such as laptop/PDAs, get connected with these APs, which in turn get connected with the wired LAN. An AP acts as a communication hub for users to connect with the wired LAN. 3. Wi-Fi hotspots: A hotspot is a site that offers the Internet access by using Wi-Fi technology over a WLAN.

Hotspots are found in public areas (such as coffee shops, public libraries, hotels and restaurants) and are commonly offered facility throughout much of North America and Europe.  Free Wi-Fi hotspots: Wireless Internet service is offered in public areas, free of cost and that to without any authentication.  Commercial hotspots: The users are redirected to authentication and online payment to avail the wireless Internet service in public areas. 4. Service Set IDentifier (SSID): It is the name of 802.11i WLAN and all wireless devices on a WLAN must use the same SSID to communicate with each other. While setting up WLAN, the user (or WLAN administrator) sets the SSID, which can be up to 32 characters long so that only the users who knew the SSID will be able to connect the WLAN. It is always advised to turn OFF the broadcast of the SSID. 5. Wired equivalence privacy (WEP): Wireless transmission is susceptible to eavesdropping and to provide confidentiality, WEP was introduced as part of the original 802.11i Protocol in 1997. It is always termed as deprecated security algorithm for IEEE 802.11i WLANs. SSID along with WEP delivers fair amount of secured wireless network. 6. Wi-Fi protected access (WPA and WPA2): WPA was introduced as an interim standard to replace WEP to improve upon the security features of WEP. WPA2 provides a stronger encryption mechanism through Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), which is a requirement for some corporate and government agencies. 7. Media access control (MAC): It is a unique identifier of each node (i.e., each network interfaces) of the network and it is assigned by the manufacturer of a network interface card (NIC) stored in its hardware. MAC address filtering allows only the devices with specific MAC addresses to access the network.

Although following summarized steps will help to improve and strengthen the security of wireless network, to know the available tools to monitor and protect the wireless networks: 1. Change the default settings of all the equipments/components of wireless network (e.g., IP address/ user IDs/administrator passwords, etc.). 2. Enable WPA/WEP encryption. 3. Change the default SSID. 4. Enable MAC address filtering. 5. Disable remote login. 6. Disable SSID broadcast. 7. Disable the features that are not used in the AP (e.g., printing/music support). 8. Avoid providing the network a name which can be easily identified (e.g., My_Home_Wifi ). 9. Connect only to secured wireless network (i.e., do not autoconnect to open Wi-Fi hotspots). 10. Upgrade router’s firmware periodically. 11. Assign static IP addresses to devices. 12. Enable firewalls on each computer and the router. 13. Position the router or AP safely. 14. Turn off the network during extended periods when not in use. 15. Periodic and regular monitor wireless network security.

Botnets, networks of virus-infected computers, are used to send about 80% of Spam.  Types of Spam E-Mails are as follows: 2. Unsolicited bulk E-Mail (UBE): It is synonym for SPAM unsolicited E-Mail sent in large quantities. 3. Unsolicited commercial E-Mail (UCE): Unsolicited E-Mails are sent in large quantities from commercial perspective, for example, advertising. See Box 5.3 to know more about US Act on Spam mails. Examples: 1. HSBC, Santander, CommonWealth Bank: International Banks having large customer base, phishers always dive deep in such ocean to attempt to hook the fish. 2. eBay: It is a popular auction site, often mimicked to gain personal information. 3. Amazon: It was the top brand to be exploited by phishers till July 2009. 4. Facebook: Netizens, who liked to be on the most popular social networking sites such as Facebook, are always subject to threats within Facebook as well as through E-Mail. One can reduce chances of being victim of Phising attack by using the services – security settings to enable contact and E-Mail details as private. The E-Mail will usually ask the user to provide valuable information about himself /herself or to “verify” information that the user may have provided in the past while Jyothi R, A ssistant Professor, Dept.of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) Page 26 registering for online account. To maximize the chances that a recipient will respond, the phisher might employ any or all of the following tactics: 1. Names of legitimate organizations: Instead of creating a phony company from scratch, the phisher might use a legitimate company’s name and incorporate the look and feel of its website (i.e., including the color scheme and graphics) into the Spam E-Mail. 2. “From” a real employee: Real name of an official, who actually works for the organization.

It is important to note the various usage of ID theft information. 1. 66% of victims’ personal information is used to open a new credit account in their name. 2. 28% of victims’ personal information is used to purchase cell phone service. 3. 12% of victims end up having warrants issued in their name for financial crimes committed by the identity thief. Personally Identifiable Information (PII) The fraudsters attempts to steal the elements mentioned below, which can express the purpose of distinguishing individual identity: 1. Full name; 2. national identification number (e.g., SSN); 3. telephone number and mobile phone number; 4. driver’s license number; 5. credit card numbers; 6. digital identity (e.g., E-Mail address, online account ID and password); 7. birth date/birth day; 8. birthplace; 9. face and fingerprints.

Differentiate between Spam and Hoax mails Spam E-Mails popular medium of Phishers to scam users • 1. HSBC, Santander, Common Wealth Bank International bank having large customer base, phishers dive deep in such ocean to attempt to hook the fish. • 2. eBay auction site often mimicked to gain personal information • 3. Amazon I t was the top brand to be exploited by phishers till July 2009. • 4. Facebook  Netizens, who liked to be on the most popular social networking sites such as Facebook, are always subject to threats within Facebook as well as through E-Mails. Tactics used by Phishers to attack the common people using E-Mails asking for valuable information about himself/herself or to verify the details • 1. Names of legitimate organizations: Instead of creating a phony company from scratch, the phisher micht use a legitimate company's name and incorporate the look and feel of its website (i.e., including the color scheme and graphics) into the Spam E-Mail. 2. From a real employee: Real name of an official, who actually works for the organization, will appear in the \"from\" line or the text of the message (or both).

Dragnet 2. Road-and-reel 3. Lobsterpot 4. Gillnet 1. Dragnet • A method involves the use of spammed E-Mails, bearing falsified corporate identification (ne.., corporate names, logos and Customers of trademarks), which are addressed to a large group of people ( a particular financial institution or members of a particular auction site) to web- sites or pop-up windows with Similarly falsified identification. • Dragnet phishers do not identify specific prospective victims in advance. • Instead, they rely on false information included in an E-Mail to trigger an immediate response by victims-typically, clicking on links in the body of the E-Mail to take the victims to the websites or pop- up windows where they are requested to enter bank or credit card account data or other personal data. J yothi R, Assistant Professor, Dept.of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) 6 2. Road-and-reel • In this method, phishers identify specific prospective victims in advance, and convey false information to them to prompt their disclosure of personal and financial data. • For example, on the phony webpage, availability of similar item for a better price (i.e., cheaper price) is displayed which the victims may be searching for and upon visiting the webpage, victims were asked for personal information such as name, bank account numbers and passwords, before confirming that the \"sale\" and the information is available to the phisher easily. • 3.

Lobsterpot • This method focuses upon use of spoofed websites. • It consists of creating of bogus/ phony websites, similar to legitimate corporate ones, targeting a narrowly defined class of victims, which is likely to seek out. • These attacks are also known as \"content injection Phishing.” • Here the phisher places a weblink into an E-Mail message to make it look more legitimate and actually takes the victim to a phony scam site, which appears as legitimate website similar to official site. These fake sites are spoofed websites. • Ones the netizens is into the one of these spoofed sites, he/she might willingly send personal information to the con artist. Then they use your information to purchase goods, apply new credit card or to steal your identity. 4. Gillnet  This technique relies far less on social engineering techniques and phishers introduce Malicious Code into E-Mails and websites.  They can, for example, misuse browser functionality by injecting hostile content into another site's pop-up window.  Merely by opening a particular E-Mail or browsing a particular website, netizens may have a Trojan Horse introduced into their systems.  In some cases, the Malicious Code will change settings in user's systems so that users who want to visit legitimate banking websites will be redirected to a look-alike Phishing site.

COM can be registered as G00GLE. COM] • Microsoft.com or/rnicrosoft.com • Phisher could create and register a domain name which appears almost identical to an existing domain and takes netizens to the Phony websites. • Phisher could easily record password or account details though spoofed websites, while passing traffic through the original websites. 2. Filter Evasion • This technique use graphics (i.e., images) instead of text to obviate from netting such E-Mails by anti-Phishing filters. Normally, these filters are inbuilt into the web browsers. For example, • Internet Explorer version 7 has inbuilt \"Microsoft phishing filter.\" One can enable it during the installation or it can be enabled post-installation. It is important to note that it is not enabled by default. • Firefox 2.0 and above has inbuilt \"Google Phishing filter.\" duly licensed from Google. It is enabled by default. • The Opera Phishing filter is dubbed Opera Fraud Protection and is included in version 9.5+. 3. Website forgery • In this technique the phisher directs the netizens to the website designed and developed by him, to login into the website, by altering the browser address bar through JavaScript commands. • As the netizen logs into the fake/bogus website, phisher gets the confidential information very easily. • Another technique used is known as \"cloaked\" URL-domain forwarding and/or inserting control characters into the URL while concealing the weblink address of the real website.

For example, \"Sir, we need to make sure that you are indeed our customer. Could you please supply your credit card information so that I can verify your identity”. • Phisher gets the required details swimmingly. 6.

Malware-based Phishing  It refers to scams that involve running Malicious Code on the netizens system.  Malware can be launched as an E-Mail attachment or as a downloadable file from a website or by exploiting known security vulnerabilities.  For example, small and medium businesses are always found to be ignorant to keep their operating systems (OS) antivirus software up to date with latest patch updates released by vendors. 3. Keyloggers  A small integrity program to steal information sends to phisher, keylogger log, to the phisher through the Internet.  The keyloggers can also be embedded into netizen's browser as a small utility program which can start automatically when the browser is opened or can be embedded into system holes as device drivers. 4. Session hijacking   It is an attack in which netizens' activities are monitored until they establish their bonafide credentials by signing into their account or begin the transaction and at that point the Malicious Code takes over and comport unauthorized actions such as transferring funds without netizen's knowledge. 5. In-session Phishing another parallel session in the same browser.:  It is a Phishing attack based upon one web browsing session being able to detect the presence of another session (such as visit to an online banking website) on the same web browser and then a pop-up window is launched that pretends to be opened from the targeted session 6. Web Trojans  Pops up to collect netizen's credentials and transmit them to the phisher while netizens are attempting to log in. Such pop-ups are usually invisible 7. Pharming I  It is a new threat evolved with a goal to steal online identity of the netizens and Pharming  Is known as one of the \"P\" in cybercrime   In Pharming, following two techniques are used:  Hosts file poisoning:  The most popular operating system (OS) in the world is Windows and It has \"host names\" in their \"hosts\" file. Jy othi R, Assistant Professor, Dept.of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) 13  A simple text file was used in web address during early days of the Internet.

System configuration attacks:  Phisher intrude into netizens system to modify settings for malicious purposes.  For example, URLs saved under favourites in the browser De modified to redirect the netizen to a fake/bogus \"look alike\" websites (i.e., URL for a of a bank can be changed from \"www.xyzbank.com to www.xyzbanc.com.). 9. Data theft   Critical and confidential data getting stolen is one of the biggest concerns in the modern times.  As more information resides on the corporate a servers and the web attackers have a boom time because taking away/copying information in electronic form is easy.  Unsecured systems are often found to be inappropriately maintained from cybersecurity perspective.  When such system is connected, the web servers can launch an attack with numerous methods and techniques. Data theft is used in business espionage. 10. Content injection Phishing:  In these types of scams, phisher replaces the part of the content of a legitimate website with false content. 11. Man-in-the middle Phishing:  Phisher is positioned himself in between the netizens and legitimate website or system.  Phisher records the input being provided by the netizen but continues to pass it on to the web server so that netizens transactions are nor affected. 12. Search engine Phishing:  It occurs when phishers create websites with attractive sounding offers (often found too good to be true) and have them indexed legitimately with search engines.  Netizens find websites during their normal course of search for products or services and are trapped to reveal their personal information.  For example, phishers set up fake/ bogus banking websites displaying an offer of lower credit costs or better interest rates than other banks offer of lower credit costs or better interest rates than other banks. Jy othi R, Assistant Professor, Dept.of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) 14 13.

Its takes hour together time. • Phishers have identified a way to invade the browser tabs and change it to a page designed to steal information. • If a page is ideal for a particular time period, and then phisher redirects the victim to a phished webpage. • Phisher judge the idle webpages based on mouse movement, scroll bar movement and keystrokes. • Websites from banking/financial institutes as well as popular sites like Gmail, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp are the primary targets. DNS Hijacking (session hijacking) • DNS Hijacking: It is also known as DNS redirection and it is the practice of redirecting the resolution of Domain Name Server (DNS) names to rogue DNS servers. • An illegal change to a DNS server directs URL to a different website. • In some cases, new websites URL may have done one different letter in the name that might go unnoticed. The bogus website might offer similar and/or competing products for sale. • DNS is used to interpret domain names such as www. <domainname>.com into an IP address.

Q1: Discuss the Historical Background of Cyberforensics Historical Background of Cyberforensics. • Forensics means a \"characteristic of evidence that satisfies its suitability for admission as fact and it persuade based upon proof. • \"Forensics science\" is the application of science to law and it is ultimately defined by use in court. 5.3 Digital Forensics Science, Digital forensics is the application of analyses techniques to the reliable and unbiased collection, analysis interpretation and presentation of digital evidence. There is a number of slightly varying definitions/The term computer forensics, however, is generally considered to be related to the use of analytical and investigative techniques to identify, collect, examine and preserve evidence/information which is magnetically stored or encoded The objective of \"Cyberforensics\" is to provide digital evidence of a specific or general activity. Following are two more definitions worth considering: 1. Computer forensics: It is the lawful and ethical seizure, acquisition, analysis, reporting and safeguarding of data and metadata derived from digital devices which may contain information that is notable and perhaps of evidentiary value to the trier of fact in managerial, administrative, civil and criminals' investigations. In other words, it is the collection of techniques and tools used to find evidence in a computer. 2. Digital forensics: It is the use of scientifically derived and proven methods toward the preservation, collection, validation, identification, analysis, interpretation, documentation Jy othi R, Assistant Professor, Dept. of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) 2 and presentation of digital evidence derived from digital sources for the purpose of facilitation or furthering the reconstruction of events found to be criminal, or helping to anticipate unauthorized actions shown to be disruptive to planned operations. It is difficult to provide a precise definition of \"digital evidence\" because the evidence is recovered from devices that are not traditionally considered to be computers. (Some researchers prefer to expand the definition by including the \"collection\" and \"examination\" of all",

(Some researchers prefer to expand the definition by including the \"collection\" and \"examination\" of all forms of digital data, including the data found in cell phones, PDAs, iPods and other electronic devices. In general, the role of digital forensics is to: . 1. Uncover and document evidence and leads. 2. Corroborate evidence discovered in other ways (E-Discovery) 3. Assist in showing a pattern of events (data mining has an application here). 4. Connect attack and victim computers (Locard's Exchange Principle) 5. Reveal an end-to-end path of events leading to a compromise attempt, successful or not. 6. Extract data that may be hidden, deleted or otherwise not directly available. . The typical scenarios involved are: 1. Employee Internet abuse 2. Data leak/ data breach - unauthorized disclosure of corporate information and data (accidental and intentional); 3. Industrial espionage (corporate \"spying\" activities); 4. damage assessment (following an incident); 5. criminal fraud and deception cases; 6. criminals Cases (many criminals simply store information on computers, intentionally or unwittingly) and countess others; 7. copyright violation Figure 5.1 shows the kind of data you \"see\" using forensics tools.

COFEE tool also provides reports in simple format that are easy for later interpretation. These reports can be used by experts and can also be used as supportive evidence for subsequent investigation and prosecution.  The COFEE fool and its underlying framework can be tailored to effectively meet the needs of a particular investigation, that is, it can be fully customized. On the lighter side, one wonders if there will also be Total Evidence Analyzer (TEA) soon. Q2: Is there a difference between computer security and computer forensics?

Enforcement mechanisms: routine preservation of IDS, firewall, router and web server logs for some configurable length of time Q3: List various Computer Forensics services available, explain any two of them. Box 5.3: Digital forensics investigations and E-discovery Digital evidence plays an important role in threat management life cycle, from incident response to high-stakes corporate litigation. Evidences involve computer hard drives, portable storage, floppy diskettes, portable music players and PDA's, etc..... Key evidences often reside on more than a user hard drive or file server, requiring the capture and analysis of evidence from enterprise productivity servers, network logs or proprietary databases. Many threats arise from illegal internet activities that extend beyond the firewall and require new investigative and forensics approaches. Forensics professionals need supporting solution for the acquisition, management and analysis of digital evidence. Such computer forensics services include the following: 1. Data culling and targeting 2. Discovery/subpoena process 3. Production of evidence 4. Expert affidavit support 5. Criminal/Civil testimony 6. Cell phone forensics 7. PDA (Personal Digital Assistants) forensics Specific client requests for forensics evidence extracting solution support include: 1. Index of files on hard drive 2. Index of recovered files 3. MS Office / user generate document extraction 4. Unique e-mail address extraction 5. Internet activity/ history 6. Keywords search 7.

Sexual harassment, theft of trade secrets, abuse of the internet and unauthorized outside employment on company time are just few examples of violation that warrant a forensics examination of a computer.  Even in investigations where hard drives are reformatted in an attempt to hide evidence, forensics discoveries can still potentially recover critical information.  Forensics discoveries can also aid in recovering passwords for critical files that have been maliciously set or changed. ⯈ There are further challenges; for example, many times, computer are reissued when employees leave. ⯈ Computer that is used continuously may destroy the incriminating evidence that can be used against a former disgruntled employee ⯈ Also, constant use of the computer may raise questions as to who created the incriminating evidence and when ⯈ To prevent these problems and to preserve potentially valuable information, it is recommended that a strict chain of custody should be followed and the subject computer should be shut down, that is, the computer on which digital evidence is believed to be residing ⯈ The following links (accessed on 28 March 2010) provide information about various tools including Deep Freeze ⯈ http://software.informer.com/getfree-deep-format-recover/ (Deep Format Recover Tools): ⯈ http://www.astahost.com/info.php/Deep-Freeze-Partition_12571.html (Deep Freeze- related Blog): ⯈ http://www.hochstadt.com/protecting-your-computer-using-deep freeze (an article here explains how you can protect your computer using \"Deep Freeze\"): ⯈ http://technodata.blogspot.com/2006/11/how-to-format-hard-disk-by- disk.html (this article explains how to format the hard disk); ⯈ 5. http://www.softlist.net/search/deep-freeze-2000-xp/ (Deep Freeze 200 XP Free Downloads): ⯈ http://www.pctechguide.com/forums/ubbthreads.php/topics/4391/Hard%20D isk%20re-format(technical blog): Jyo thi R, Assistant Professor, Dept. of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) 6 Q4: Discuss the need for concept of Computer Forensics 5.4 Need for Computer Forensics, ⯈ The convergence of information and communication technology (ICT) advances and the pervasive use of computer worldwide together have brought many advantages to mankind. ⯈ At the same time, this tremendously high technical capacity of modern computer/computing devices provides avenues for misuse as well as opportunities for committing crime. ⯈ This leads to new risks for computer users and also increased opportunities for social harm. ⯈ The users, businesses and organizations worldwide have to live with a constant threat from hackers who use a variety of techniques and tools to break into the computer to steal information, change data and cause havoc. ⯈ The widespread use of computer forensics is the result of two factors: 1.

Box 5.4: Chain of Custody Example CASE STUDY Officer Amar collects the knife and places it into a container, then gives it to forensic technician Balan. Forensics technician Balan takes the knife to the laboratory and collects fingerprints and other evidence from the knife. He then gives the knife and all evidence gathered from the knife to evidence clerk Charu. Charu then stores the evidence until it needed, documenting everyone who has accessed the original evidence (the knife and original copies of the lifted fingerprints). The chain of custody requires that from the moment the evidence is collected, every transfer of Evidence from one person to another person should be documented as it helps to prove that nobody else could have accessed that evidence. It is advisable to keep the number of evidence transfers as low as possible. In the courtroom, if the defendant challenges the chain of custody of the evidence, it can be proven that the knife in the evidence room is the same as found at the crime scene. However, if due to some discrepancies it cannot be proven who had the knife at a particular point in time. Then the chain of custody is broken and the defendant can ask to have the resulting evidence declares inadmissible.

They also, at times, have an apprehension that the law of evidence as per Indian Evidence Act of 1872 may not hold good for electronic evidence. Some lawyers express doubts and apprehensions about the process of leading electronic evidence in the courts. However, this is not true; the traditional principles of leading evidence, along with certain newly added provisions in the Indian Evidence Act 1972 through the Information Technology Act (ITA) 2000, constitute the body of law applicable to electronic evidence. The challenges, however, need to be understood from the \"rules of evidence\" perspective. Paper evidence, the process is clear and intuitively obvious. Digital evidence by its very nature Invisible to the eye. Therefore, the evidence must be developed using tools other than the is human eye. There are number of contexts involved in actually identifying a piece of digital evidence: 1. Physical context: It must be definable in its physical form, that is, it should reside on a specific piece of media. 2. Logical context: It must be identifiable as to its logical position, that is, where does it reside relative to the file system. 3. Legal context: We must place the evidence in the correct context to read its meaning, this may require looking at the evidence as machine language, for example, American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII).

Needless to say, your procedures should be implementable. As with any aspect of an incident response policy, procedures should be tested to ensure feasibility, particularly, in a crisis. If possible, procedures should be automated for reasons of speed and accuracy. Being methodical always helps. 10. For each device, a systematic approach should be adopted to follow the guidelines laid down in your collection procedure. Speed will often be critical; therefore, where there are a number of devices requiring examination, it may be appropriate to spread the work among your team to collect the evidence in parallel. However, on a single given system collection should be done step by step. 11. Proceed from the volatile to the less volatile; order of volatility is as follows:  Registers, cache (most volatile, i.e., contents lost as soon as the power is turned OFF); routing table, Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) cache, process table, kernel statistics, memory;  Temporary file systems;  disk;  remote logging and monitoring data that is relevant to the system in question;  physical configuration and network topology;  archival media (least volatile, i.e., holds data even after power is turned OFF). 12. we should make a bit-level copy of the system's media. If we wish to do forensics analysis we should make a bit-level copy of pour evidence copy for that purpose, as our analysis will almost certainly alter file access times. try to avoid doing forensics on the evidence copy. Note: Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a very important part of IP networking. ARP is used to connect O er (Network) to OSI Laver 2 (Datalink), For most of us this means that ARP is used to link to our IP addressing to our Ethernet addressing (MAC Addressing). For you to communicate with any device on you network, you must have the Ethernet MAC address for that device. If that device is not on your land you go to your default gateway.

Digital forensic process needs to be understood in the legal context starting from preparation of the evidence to testifying. Digital forensic evidences consist of exhibits each consisting of a sequence of BITS presented by witnesses in legal matter to help Jurors established the facts of the case and support or refute legal theories of the case. the exhibit should be introduced and presented and our challenge by properly qualified people using a properly applied methodology that address is the legal theories and issue Expert witness is very important and is associated with Digital forensic evidence. as per the court procedure the exhibits are introduced as evidences by either side. testimony is presented to established the process to identify collect preserve transport store analyse interpret at tribute and or reconstruct the information contained in the exhibit and to establish to the standard of proof required by the matter at hand that the evidence reflects the sequence of events that is asserted to have produced it. The assumption is that adequate facts can be established for the introduction of an evidence exhibit. people involved in the chain of custody need to justify a number of aspects relating to the evidence- the testimonial typically include the process of used for creating handling and introducing the evidence the method used for collecting the exhibit as well as the manner in which the exhibit is brought to court.

Handling of digital evidence requires special expertise that come from training and experience. A forensics expert team brings the following additional benefits: 1. Technology expertise: This is perhaps the biggest advantage of partnership with a computer forensics expert. As an example of the technological complexity, consider the proliferation of operating systems in the last decade: mainframe operating systems, Windows 95/98, UNIX, Linux, Windows NT, Windows Server, Macintosh, Windows 2000, Windows XP and Novell Netware. Specific forensics tools must be used with each of these file systems, along with training and experience to interpret search results. Although some evidence may be found easily, other evidence may have been deleted, altered, hidden or encrypted. Forensics experts routinely deal with such complexities and nuances. 2. Forensics methodology: A comprehensive forensics methodology, repeatable and defensible, has become a key attribute in choosing a forensics expert firm. Proper use of a repeatable process prevents making the same mistake twice, ensures proper chain of custody, leverages successful techniques from prior cases, supports clear and concise testimony, and generally guarantees efficient forensics case management. 3. Experience and efficiency: The tools and methods of computer forensics examination are still in their infancy. Experts know how to quickly navigate through the variety of esoteric tools and procedures. Experts also have the experience to cull thousands of files based on patterns and keywords. Therefore, working with experts will efficiently produce relevant results for counsel. Jyo thi R, Assistant Professor, Dept. of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) 15 5.6.2.

If the evidence cannot be identified as relevant evidence it may be never be collected or process that all and may not even continue to exit in digital form by the time it is discovered to have relevance Collecting and Recording Digital Evidence.  Digital evidence can be collected from many sources.  The sources are computers, cell phones, digital cameras hard drives, CD-ROM, USB memory devices and so on.  Non-obvious sources include settings of digital thermometers, black boxes inside automobiles, RFID tags and webpages (which must be preserved as they are subject to change).  Special care must be taken when handling computer evidence: most digital  information is easily changed, and once changed it is usually impossible to detect that a change has taken place unless other measures have been taken.  For this reason, it is common practice to calculate a cryptographic hash of an evidence file and to record that hash elsewhere, usually in an investigator's notebook, so that one can establish at a later point in time that the evidence has not been modified as the hash was calculated.  Figures 5 .6 and 5.7 show the media that typically holds digital evidence. Collecting volatile data requires special technical skills If the machine is still active any intelligence that can be gained by examining the applications currently open is recorded. if the machine is suspected of being used for illegal communication such as terrorist traffic not all of this information may be stored on the hard drive. If information told solely in Random Access Memory and not recovered before powering down it may be lost. This results in the need to collect volatile data from the computer at the onset of the response. Memory falls under the family of solid-state non-time memory it is used in some drive USB sticks cell phone game console secure digital card and multimedia cards. This technology differs from the normal hard disc by not containing any moving parts in every device that interact with our daily life. The benefit of Embedded memory continues to increase life expectancy. figure 5.8 shows the various types of embedded memories inside a computer ROM, PROM, EPROM, EEPROM.

In the digital forensics arena, there are usually only a finite number of possible events sequences that could have produced evidence; however, the actual number of possible sequences may be almost unfathomably large. In essence, almost any execution of an instruction by the computing environment containing or generating the evidence may have an impact on the evidence. Basic ally, all digital evidence must be analysed to determine the type of information that is stored upon it. For this purpose, specialty tools are used that can display information in a format useful to investigators. Such forensics tools include but are not limited to the following list. 1. Access Data's FTK 2. guidance Software's EnCase; 3. Dr. Golden Richard III's file carving tool Scalpel; \"file carving\" is the process of recovering files from an investigative target, potentially without knowledge of the file system structure; 4. Brian Carrier's Sleuth Kitl5l: The Sleuth Kit (TSK) is a library and collection of Unix- and Windows based tools and utilities to allow for the forensics analysis of computer systems. Box 5.10: The file carving techniques are File carving is a process of recovering the files from an investigative target, potential without knowledge of the file system structure. the process is based on information about the format of the file types of interest, as well as on assumption about how files are typically laid out on block devices. if the file system metadata is used at all, it is typically used only for establishing cluster sizes and avoiding carving of undeleted file. covering is an important technique for Digital forensic investigation and for simple data recovery. Why using a database of headers and footers for specific file types file covers can retri files from a raw disc image regardless of the type of a file system on the disc image. File carving ignore the file system and car of the images directly from the data blocks. in cases of fragmented files, the carbon returns in perfect photo but this image might be sufficient to identify the subject. (As in fig. 5.9) Jyo thi R, Assistant Professor, Dept. of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) 20 Digital analysis is very important in Digital forensic because a digital investigation may encounter many forms of digital data and therefore there is a several types of digital analysis. The different analysis types are based on interpretation obstruction layers which are generally part of the data design. For example, consider the date on a hard disc which has been designed with several interpretation layers lowest layer me contain partitions or other containers that are used for volume management.

Why using a database of headers and footers for specific file types file covers can retri files from a raw disc image regardless of the type of a file system on the disc image. File carving ignore the file system and car of the images directly from the data blocks. in cases of fragmented files, the carbon returns in perfect photo but this image might be sufficient to identify the subject. (As in fig. 5.9) Jyo thi R, Assistant Professor, Dept. of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) 20 Digital analysis is very important in Digital forensic because a digital investigation may encounter many forms of digital data and therefore there is a several types of digital analysis. The different analysis types are based on interpretation obstruction layers which are generally part of the data design. For example, consider the date on a hard disc which has been designed with several interpretation layers lowest layer me contain partitions or other containers that are used for volume management. Inside each partition is data that has been organised into a file system or database. Data in the file system is interpreted to create file that contain data in an application specific format and requirement What are the common digital analysis types: 1. Media analysis: It is analysis of the data from a storage device. This analysis does not consider any partitions or other operating system (OS)-specific data structures. If the storage device uses a fixed size unit, such as a sector, then it can be used in this analysis. 2. Media management analysis: It is analysis of the management system use d to organize media. This typically involves partitions and may include volume management or redundant array of independent (or inexpensive) disks (RAID, see Box 5.11) systems chat merge data from multiple storage devices into a single virtual storage device. 3. File system analysis: It is the analysis of the file system data inside a partition or disk. This typically involves processing the data to extract the contents of a fil e or to recover the contents of a deleted files. 4. Application analysis: It is the analysis of the data inside a file. Files are created by users and applications. The format of the contents is application-specific. Jyo thi R, Assistant Professor, Dept. of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) 21 5. Network analysis: It is the analysis of data on a communications network. Network packers can be examined using the OSI Model to interpret the raw data into an application- level scream. Analysis types are OS analysis: An OS is an application; it is the first one that is run when a computer starts. This analysis examines another configuration file and output data of the OS to determine what events may be occurred. Executable analysis: executables are digital object that can cause events to occur and their frequently examine during intrusion investigation because the investigator needs to determine what events the executable could cause 6. Image analysis: image is a single searchable file. Digital images are the target of many digital investigations because some are Contraband. this type of analysis Looks for information about where the picture was taken and",

RAID stands for redundant array of independent discs. It is category of disc drive that employees' multiple drives in combination for fault tolerance and performance. The use of raid describe is frequent on servers, the uses not generally necessary for personal computer. storage technology had become too expensive to place a large number of high-capacity hard drive in the servers. the response to the situation came through the concept of raid subsequently rate become very popular. Note that data stripping me spreading out block for each file access multiple disc drives. It was a system developed as a solution to link together a large number of low-cost hard drive with a view to form a single large capacity storage device that provided superior performance storage capacity and reliability as compared to the older storage solutions. since then, RAID become widely used and is deployed as an enterprise storage method in server market. Attractiveness of RAID comes from the fat that the array of disc distributed the data across multiple discs. however, the computer user and operating system to the serve such. The different RAID levels are level 0: this is nothing but a strip would Disc a rate without fault tolerance. it provides data stripping but no redundancy. this results in an improved performance however it does not deliver fault tolerance all data in the array is lost if one drive fails.

This is bit interleaved parity level 3 provides byte level stripping with a dedicated parity disc. It is really used probably because it cannot service simultaneous multiple requests. level 4: this is dedicated parity drive. its use is common for implementation of RAID.

Explain the chain Custody Concepts in Cyber Forensics 5.7 Chain of Custody Concepts, A chain of custody is the process of validating how many kinds of evidences have been gathered, tracked and protected on the way to a court of law It is essential to get in the habit of protecting all evidences equally so that they will hold up in court. Forensic nvestigation professionals know that if you do not have a chain of custody, the evidence is worthless. They learn to deal with everything as if it would go to litigation. Purpose of the chain of custody is that the proponent of a piece of evidence must demonstrate that it is what it purports to be. In other words, there is a reliable information to suggest that the party offering the evidence can demonstrate the piece of evidence is actually, in fact, what the party claims it to be and can further demonstrate its origin and the handling of the evidence because it was acquired. The Chain of Custody is a chronological written record of those individuals who have had custody of the evidence from, its initial acquisition until its final disposition. A chain of custody begins when an item of relevant evidence is collected, and the chain is maintained until the evidence is disposed off (Figs. 5.10 and 5.11). The chain of custody assumes continuous accountability. This accountability is important because, if not properly maintained, an item (of evidence) may be inadmissible 5.8 Network forensics. • Open networks can be source of many network-based cyberattack • Wireless Forensics • Wireless Forensics is a discipline included within the computer forensics science, and specifically, within the network forensics field. • The goal of wireless forensics is to provide the methodology and) tools required to collect network traffic that can be presented as valid digital evidence a court of law.
