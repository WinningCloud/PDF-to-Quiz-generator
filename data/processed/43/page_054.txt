 The next step is to remove any evidence of the attack. The attacker will usually
install a set of tools that replace existing files and services with Trojan files
and services that have a backdoor password.
5. Grab the data:
 Now that the attacker has “captured the network,” he/she takes advantage of his/her
position to steal confidential data
6. Covering tracks:
 This is the last step in any cyber attack, which refers to the activities undertaken
by the attacker to extend misuse of the system without being detected.
 The attacker can remain undetected for long periods.
 During this entire process, the attacker takes optimum care to hide his/her identity
(ID) from the first step itself.
Proxy Servers and Anonymizers
Proxy server is a computer on a network which acts as an intermediary for connection with
other computers on that network.
 The attacker first connects to a proxy server and establishes a connection with the
target system through existing connection with proxy.
 This enables an attacker to surf on the Web anonymously and/or hide the attack.
 A client connects to the proxy server and requests some services (such as a file, webpage)
available from a different server.
 The proxy server evaluates the request and provides the resource by establishing
the connection to the respective server and/or requests the required service on
behalf of the client.
 Using a proxy server can allow an attacker to hide ID (i.e., become anonymous
on the network).
A proxy server has following purposes:
1. Keep the systems behind the curtain (mainly for security reasons).
2. Speed up access to a resource (through “caching”). It is usually used to cache the web
pages from a web server.
3. Specialized proxy servers are used to filter unwanted content such as advertisements.
4. Proxy server can be used as IP address multiplexer to enable to connect number of
