CYBERSECURITY FOR
SMALL BUSINESS
SECURE
REMOTE ACCESS
Employees and vendors may need to connect to your network remotely.
Put your network’s security first. Make employees and vendors follow strong security standards before
they connect to your network. Give them the tools to make security part of their work routine.
HOW TO
PROTECT DEVICES
Whether employees or vendors use company-issued devices or their own when
connecting remotely to your network, those devices should be secure. Follow these
tips — and make sure your employees and vendors do as well:
Always change any pre-set router passwords and the
default name of your router. And keep the router’s
software up to date; you may have to visit the router’s
website often to do so.
Consider enabling full-disk encryption for laptops and
other mobile devices that connect remotely to your
network. Check your operating system for this option,
which will protect any data stored on the device if it’s
lost or stolen. This is especially important if the device
stores any sensitive personal information.
Change smartphone settings to stop automatic
connections to public Wi-Fi.
Keep up-to-date antivirus software on devices that
connect to your network, including mobile devices.
