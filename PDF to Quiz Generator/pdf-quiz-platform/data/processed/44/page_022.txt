WHAT TO Software updates
LOOK FOR Many web host providers offer pre-built websites or software
packages designed to make it quick and easy to set up your
company’s website. As with any software, it is essential that you
use the latest versions with up-to-date security patches. Make
sure you know how to keep the website’s software up to date,
or whether the web host provider will do this for you.
Website management
If a web host provider is managing your website, you may have
to go through that provider to make any changes — though you
may be able to log in and make some changes yourself. Some
web host providers may instead offer you the option of managing
the website on your own. It’s important to clarify from the
beginning who will manage the website after it’s built.
