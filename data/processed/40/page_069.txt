 Buffer overflow technique is employed to commit such kind of criminal attack known as
Spoofing.
 The term IP address Spoofing refers to the creation of IP packets with a forged (spoofed)
source IP address with the purpose of concealing the ID of the sender or impersonating
another computing system.
 A packet is a formatted unit of data carried by a packet mode computer network.
 The attacker spoofs the IP address and floods the network of the victim with repeated
requests.
 As the IP address is fake, the victim machine keeps waiting for response from the
attacker’s machine for each request.
 This consumes the bandwidth of the network which then fails to serve the legitimate
requests and ultimately breaks down.
 The United States Computer Emergency Response Team defines symptoms of DoS
attacks to include:
1. Unusually slow network performance (opening fi les or accessing websites);
2. unavailability of a particular website;
3. inability to access any website;
4. dramatic increase in the number of Spam E-Mails received (this type of DoS
attack is termed as an E-Mail bomb).
The goal of DoS is not to gain unauthorized access to systems or data, but to prevent
intended users (i.e., legitimate users) of a service from using it.
A DoS attack may do the following:
1. Flood a network with traffic, thereby preventing legitimate network traffic.
2. Disrupt connections between two systems, thereby preventing access to a service.
3. Prevent a particular individual from accessing a service.
4. Disrupt service to a specific system or person.
Classification of DoS Attacks
1. Bandwidth attacks: Loading any website takes certain time. Loading means complete
webpage appearing on the screen and system is awaiting user’s input.
