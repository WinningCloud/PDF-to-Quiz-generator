HOW TO YOUR BUSINESS
If a caller says your computer has a problem, hang up. A tech support call you don’t expect is a scam
— even if the number is local or looks legitimate. These scammers use fake caller ID information to
look like local businesses or trusted companies.
If you get a pop-up message to call tech support, ignore it. Some pop-up messages about computer
issues are legitimate, but do not call a number or click on a link that appears in a pop-up message
warning you of a computer problem.
If you’re worried about a virus or other threat, call your security software company directly, using
the phone number on its website, the sales receipt, or the product packaging. Or consult a trusted
security professional.
Never give someone your password, and don’t give remote access to your computer to someone
who contacts you unexpectedly.
