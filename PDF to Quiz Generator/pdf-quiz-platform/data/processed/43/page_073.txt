transmit data to wireless-enabled devices such as laptops and PDAs.
 Wireless networks are generally composed of two basic elements
o access points (APs) and
o other wireless-enabled devices, such as laptops radio transmitters and receivers to

signals with which a wireless device can connect.
 Wireless access to networks has become very common by now in India – for
