3. In reality only 0.3814th of photons actually make it to the wafer since we know that ranging from
source through the mask onto the wafer the reflectivity is 0.7 percent.
 Resist
1. Resists used are very similar to those used in wavelengths 248 and 193 nm resists
2. All previous resists had photons hitting at them with energy 6 or 7ev but now the energy is 92ev, so
with such high energy hitting the resist, it generates secondary electrons and photon electrons which
lead to degradation of image quality.
3. Line width roughness and sensitivity are inversely proportional. Higher the sensitivity lower will be
the roughness, which means much higher dose of photons is required to form the patterns, which
depict low roughness.
6. CONCLUSION
Lithography is the base to excel in in the semiconductor industry. For many applications smaller is better in
terms of speed, power consumption and cost. This paper discussed future lithographic techniques briefly. While
the critical dimension in the microprocessor industry is constantly going down; stringent demands should be
made on contamination control, yield enhancement and particle detection. There still remains debate over costs
of many of these methods and the ability to manufacture integrated circuits in large volume. The ability to
manufacture small devices is crucial for applications in many different areas including microwave circuits, high-
speed optics as well as bio-electronic devices. There is a demand for high-resolution Lithography capability
combined with extreme reproducibility over large areas. Historically photolithography has been the dominant
technique for replication since the origin of microelectronic devices. Several other techniques are on the edge of
technological breakthroughs.
