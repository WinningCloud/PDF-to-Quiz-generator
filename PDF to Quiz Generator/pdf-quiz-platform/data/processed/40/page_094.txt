CSRF is also known as a one-click attack or session riding (abbreviated as CSRF
or XSRF) and is a type of malicious exploit of a website where by unauthorized
commands are transmitted from a user that the website trusts.
Unlike cross-site scripting (XSS), which exploits the trust a user has on a
particular site, CSRF exploits the trust that a site has in a user's browser.
Phishing vis-à-vis Spoofing
• 1. Phishing is used to get the victim to reveal valuable (or at times invaluable)
information about him/her. Phishers would use Spoofing to create a fake E-Mail.
• 2. Spoofing is not intended to steal information but to actually make the victim
do something for phishers.
• 3. Phishing may, at times, require Spoofing to entice the victim into revealing the
information about Spoofing does not always necessarily result in Phishing
someone else's account
The Combined Attack - Phishing and Spoofing
• Phisher sends an E-Mail, during Income Tax return fling period, from an official
looking IT (Income Tax) account which is spoofed.
• The E-Mail would contain URL to download a new tax form that was recently
issued.
• Once the victim clicks the URL a "virus cum Trojan Horse" is downloaded to the
victim's system.
• The IT Form may seem official, but like a Trojan Horse, the payload has already
been delivered.
• The virus lies in wait, logging the actions of the victim.
• Once the victim inputs certain keywords, like bank names, credit card names,
social networking websites and so forth, it logs the site and the passwords used.
• Those results are flagged and sent to the phisher.
• The virus could then gather the user's E-Mail contacts and send a fake E-Mail to
them as well, containing the virus.
• The phisher now has gained the required personal information as well as virus
was sent, downloaded and spread to entice other netizens.
