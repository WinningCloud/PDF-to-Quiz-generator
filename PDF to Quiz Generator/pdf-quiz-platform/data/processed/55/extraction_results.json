The subject matter of\neach domain can easily be seen as its own area of study, and in many cases individuals\nwork exclusively in these fields as experts. For many of these subjects, you can consult\nand reference extensive resources to become an expert in that area. Because of this, a\ncommon misconception is that the only way to succeed at the CISSP exam is to im-\nmerse yourself in a massive stack of texts and study materials. Fortunately, an easier\napproach exists. By using this sixth edition of the CISSP All-in-One Exam Guide, you can\nsuccessfully complete and pass the CISSP exam and achieve your CISSP certification.\nThe goal of this book is to combine into a single resource all the information you need\nto pass the CISSP exam and help you understand how the domains interact with each\nother so that you can develop a comprehensive approach to security practices. This\nbook should also serve as a useful reference tool long after you’ve achieved your CISSP\ncertification.\nWhy Become a CISSP?\nAs our world changes, the need for improvements in security and technology continues\nto grow. Security was once a hot issue only in the field of technology, but now it is be-\ncoming more and more a part of our everyday lives. Security is a concern of every orga-\nnization, government agency, corporation, and military unit. Ten years ago computer\nand information security was an obscure field that only concerned a few people. Because\nthe risks were essentially low, few were interested in security expertise.\n1",

With a\nCISSP certification, you will be seen as a security professional of proven ability who has\nsuccessfully met a predefined standard of knowledge and experience that is well under-\nstood and respected throughout the industry. By keeping this certification current, you\nwill demonstrate your dedication to staying abreast of security developments.\nConsider the reasons for attaining a CISSP certification:\n• To meet the growing demand and to thrive in an ever-expanding field\n• To broaden your current knowledge of security concepts and practices\n• To bring security expertise to your current occupation\n• To become more marketable in a competitive workforce\n• To show a dedication to the security discipline\n• To increase your salary and be eligible for more employment opportunities\nThe CISSP certification helps companies identify which individuals have the ability,\nknowledge, and experience necessary to implement solid security practices; perform\nrisk analysis; identify necessary countermeasures; and help the organization as a whole\nprotect its facility, network, systems, and information. The CISSP certification also\nshows potential employers you have achieved a level of proficiency and expertise in\nskill sets and knowledge required by the security industry. The increasing importance\nplaced on security in corporate success will only continue in the future, leading to even\ngreater demands for highly skilled security professionals. The CISSP certification shows\nthat a respected third-party organization has recognized an individual’s technical and\ntheoretical knowledge and expertise, and distinguishes that individual from those who\nlack this level of knowledge.\nUnderstanding and implementing security practices is an essential part of being a\ngood network administrator, programmer, or engineer. Job descriptions that do not\nspecifically target security professionals still often require that a potential candidate\nhave a good understanding of security concepts as well as how to implement them. Due\nto staff size and budget restraints, many organizations can’t afford separate network\nand security staffs. But they still believe security is vital to their organization. Thus, they\noften try to combine knowledge of technology and security into a single role. With a\nCISSP designation, you can put yourself head and shoulders above other individuals in\nthis regard.\nThe CISSP Exam\nBecause the CISSP exam covers the ten domains making up the CISSP Common Body\nof Knowledge (CBK), it is often described as being “an inch deep and a mile wide,” a\nreference to the fact that many questions on the exam are not very detailed and do not\nrequire you to be an expert in every subject. However, the questions do require you to\nbe familiar with many different security subjects.",

      "text": "Chapter 1: Becoming a CISSP\n3\nThe CISSP exam comprises 250 multiple-choice questions, and you have up to six\nhours to complete it. The questions are pulled from a much larger question bank to\nensure the exam is as unique as possible for each entrant. In addition, the test bank\nconstantly changes and evolves to more accurately reflect the real world of security. The\nexam questions are continually rotated and replaced in the bank as necessary. Each\nquestion has four answer choices, only one of which is correct. Only 225 questions are\ngraded, while 25 are used for research purposes. The 25 research questions are inte-\ngrated into the exam, so you won’t know which go toward your final grade. To pass the\nexam, you need a minimum raw score of 700 points out of 1,000. Questions are\nweighted based on their difficulty; not all questions are worth the same number of\npoints. The exam is not product- or vendor-oriented, meaning no questions will be\nspecific to certain products or vendors (for instance, Windows, Unix, or Cisco). Instead,\nyou will be tested on the security models and methodologies used by these types of\nsystems.\n(ISC)2, which stands for International Information Systems Security Certification\nConsortium, has also added scenario-based questions to the CISSP exam. These ques-\ntions present a short scenario to the test taker rather than asking the test taker to iden-\ntify terms and/or concepts. The goal of the scenario-based questions is to ensure that\ntest takers not only know and understand the concepts within the CBK, but also can\napply this knowledge to real-life situations. This is more practical because in the real\nworld, you won’t be challenged by having someone asking you “What is the definition\nof collusion?” You need to know how to detect and prevent collusion from taking place,\nin addition to knowing the definition of the term.\nAfter passing the exam, you will be asked to supply documentation, supported by a\nsponsor, proving that you indeed have the type of experience required to obtain this\ncertification. The sponsor must sign a document vouching for the security experience\nyou are submitting. So, make sure you have this sponsor lined up prior to registering\nfor the exam and providing payment. You don’t want to pay for and pass the exam, only\nto find you can’t find a sponsor for the final step needed to achieve your certification.\nThe reason behind the sponsorship requirement is to ensure that those who achieve\nthe certification have real-world experience to offer organizations. Book knowledge is\nextremely important for understanding theory, concepts, standards, and regulations,\nbut it can never replace hands-on experience. Proving your practical experience sup-\nports the relevance of the certification.\nA small sample group of individuals selected at random will be audited after pass-\ning the exam. The audit consists mainly of individuals from (ISC)2 calling on the can-\ndidates’ sponsors and contacts to verify the test taker’s related experience.\nWhat makes this exam challenging is that most candidates, although they work in\nthe security field, are not necessarily familiar with all ten CBK domains. If a security\nprofessional is considered an expert in vulnerability testing or application security, for\nexample, she may not be familiar with physical security, cryptography, or forensics.\nThus, studying for this exam will broaden your knowledge of the security field.\nThe exam questions address the ten CBK security domains, which are described in\nTable 1-1.",

For example, the CISSP exam given in 1998 did not have questions pertaining to\nwireless security, cross-site scripting attacks, or IPv6.\nOther examples of material not on past exams include security governance, instant\nmessaging, phishing, botnets, VoIP, and spam. Though these subjects weren’t issues in\nthe past, they are now.\nThe test is based on internationally accepted information security standards and\npractices. If you look at the (ISC)2 website for test dates and locations, you may find, for\nexample, that the same test is offered this Tuesday in California and next Wednesday in\nSaudi Arabia.\nIf you do not pass the exam, you have the option of retaking it as soon as you like.\n(ISC)2 used to subject individuals to a waiting period before they could retake the exam,\nbut this rule has been removed. (ISC)2 keeps track of which exam version you were\ngiven on your first attempt and ensures you receive a different version for any retakes.\n(ISC)2 also provides a report to a CISSP candidate who did not pass the exam, detailing\nthe areas where the candidate was weakest. Though you could retake the exam soon\nafterward, it’s wise to devote additional time to these weak areas to improve your score\non the retest.\nCISSP: A Brief History\nHistorically, the field of computer and information security has not been a structured\nand disciplined profession; rather, the field has lacked many well-defined professional\nobjectives and thus has often been misperceived.\nIn the mid-1980s, members of the computer security profession recognized that\nthey needed a certification program that would give their profession structure and pro-\nvide ways for security professionals to demonstrate competence and to present evi-\ndence of their qualifications. Establishing such a program would help the credibility of\nthe security profession as a whole and the individuals who comprise it.\nIn November 1988, the Special Interest Group for Computer Security (SIG-CS) of\nthe Data Processing Management Association (DPMA) brought together several organi-",

They included the Infor-\nmation Systems Security Association (ISSA), the Canadian Information Processing\nSociety (CIPS), the Computer Security Institute (CSI), Idaho State University, and sev-\neral U.S. and Canadian government agencies. As a voluntary joint effort, these organi-\nzations developed the necessary components to offer a full-fledged security certification\nfor interested professionals. (ISC)2 was formed in mid-1989 as a nonprofit corporation\nto develop a security certification program for information systems security practitio-\nners. The certification was designed to measure professional competence and to help\ncompanies in their selection of security professionals and personnel. (ISC)2 was estab-\nlished in North America, but quickly gained international acceptance and now offers\ntesting capabilities all over the world.\nBecause security is such a broad and diversified field in the technology and business\nworld, the original consortium decided on an information systems security CBK com-\nposed of ten domains that pertain to every part of computer, network, business, and\ninformation security. In addition, because technology continues to rapidly evolve, stay-\ning up-to-date on security trends, technology, and business developments is required to\nmaintain the CISSP certification. The group also developed a Code of Ethics, test speci-\nfications, a draft study guide, and the exam itself.\nHow Do You Sign Up for the Exam?\nTo become a CISSP, start at www.isc2.org, where you will find an exam registration\nform you must fill out and send to (ISC)2. You will be asked to provide your security\nwork history, as well as documents for the necessary educational requirements. You\nwill also be asked to read the (ISC)2 Code of Ethics and to sign a form indicating that\nyou understand these requirements and promise to abide by them. You then provide\npayment along with the completed registration form, where you indicate your prefer-\nence as to the exam location. The numerous testing sites and dates can be found at\nwww.isc2.org.\nWhat Does This Book Cover?\nThis book covers everything you need to know to become an (ISC)2-certified CISSP. It\nteaches you the hows and whys behind organization’s development and implementa-\ntion of policies, procedures, guidelines, and standards. It covers network, application,\nand system vulnerabilities; what exploits them; and how to counter these threats. The\nbook explains physical security, operational security, and why systems implement the\nsecurity mechanisms they do. It also reviews the U.S. and international security criteria\nand evaluations performed on systems for assurance ratings, what these criteria\nmean,and why they are used. This book also explains the legal and liability issues that\nsurround computer systems and the data they hold, including such subjects as com-\nputer crimes, forensics, and what should be done to properly prepare computer evi-\ndence associated with these topics for court.\nWhile this book is mainly intended to be used as a study guide for the CISSP exam,\nit is also a handy reference guide for use after your certification.",
