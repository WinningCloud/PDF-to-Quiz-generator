1. Viruses and worms: These are known as infectious malware. They spread from one computer
system to another with a particular behavior.
2. Trojan Horses: A Trojan Horse,[14] Trojan for short, is a term used to describe malware that

Virus and Worms
 Computer virus is a program that can “infect” legitimate programs by modifying them to
include a possibly “evolved” copy of itself.
 Viruses spread themselves, without the knowledge or permission of the users, to potentially
large numbers of programs on many machines.
 A computer virus passes from computer to computer in a similar manner as a biological
virus passes from person to person.
 Viruses may also contain malicious instructions that may cause damage or annoyance; the
combination of possibly Malicious Code with the ability to spread is what makes viruses a
considerable concern.
 Viruses can often spread without any readily visible symptoms.
 A virus can start on event-driven effects (e.g., triggered after a specific number of
executions), time-driven effects (e.g., triggered on a specific date, such as Friday the 13th)
or can occur at random.
Viruses can take some typical actions:
