Tactics used by Phishers to attack the common people using E-Mails asking for
valuable information about himself/herself or to verify the details
• 1. Names of legitimate organizations:
Instead of creating a phony company from scratch, the phisher micht use a legitimate
company's name and incorporate the look and feel of its website (i.e., including the color
scheme and graphics) into the Spam E-Mail.
2. From a real employee:
Real name of an official, who actually works for the organization, will appear in the
"from" line or the text of the message (or both). This way, if a user contacts the
organization to confirm whether "Rajeev Arora" truly is "Vice President of
Marketing" then the user gets a positive response and feels assured.
