Identity Theft (ID Theft)
 This term is used to refer to fraud that involves someone pretending to be someone else to
steal money or get other benefits.
 ID theft is a punishable offense under the Indian IT Act (Section 66C and Section 66D).
 The statistics on ID theft proves the severity of this fraud and hence a non-profit
organization was found in the US, named as Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC),
with the objective to extend the support to the society to spread awareness about this fraud.
