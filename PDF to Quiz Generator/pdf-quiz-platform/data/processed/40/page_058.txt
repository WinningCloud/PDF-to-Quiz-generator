victim and the server to which a victim is connected.
 When a victim client connects to the fraudulent server, the MITM server intercepts the call,
hashes the password and passes the connection to the victim server (e.g., an attacker within
reception range of an unencrypted Wi-Fi wireless access point can insert himself as a man-
in- the-middle).
 This type of attack is used to obtain the passwords for E-Mail accounts on public websites
such as Yahoo, Hotmail and Gmail and can also used to get the passwords for
financial websites that would like to gain the access to banking websites.
Offline Attacks
 Mostly offline attacks are performed from a location other than the target (i.e., either
a computer system or while on the network) where these passwords reside or are used.
 Offline attacks usually require physical access to the computer and copying the password
file from the system onto removable media.
Password guidelines.
1. Passwords used for business E-Mail accounts, personal E-Mail accounts and
banking/financial user accounts should be kept separate.
2. Passwords should be of minimum eight alphanumeric characters (common names or
phrases should be phrased).
3. Passwords should be changed every 30/45 days.
4. Passwords should not be shared with relatives and/or friends.
5. Password used previously should not be used while renewing the password.
6. Passwords of personal E-Mail accounts and banking/financial user accounts should be
changed from a secured system, within couple of days, if these E-Mail accounts
has been accessed from public Internet facilities such as cybercafes/hotels/libraries.
7. Passwords should not be stored under mobile phones/PDAs, as these devices are also prone
to cyberattacks.
8. In case E-Mail accounts/user accounts have been hacked, respective agencies/institutes
should be contacted immediately.
