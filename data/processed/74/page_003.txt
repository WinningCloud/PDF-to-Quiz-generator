Figure 1.Classification of Lithography
In the following subsections, steps are discussed to create integrated circuits using lithography along with the
terminology.
Terminology
1. Wafer / Substrate: The substance on which pattern of integrated circuits are developed by different steps
of lithography
2. Photoresist: Is a photosensitive film placed on the top of the wafer There are two
types of photoresist:-
 Positive Photo resist: Becomes more soluble in developer solution when exposed to radiation.
 Negative Photo resist: Becomes less soluble in developer solution when exposed to radiation.
3. Pattern: It is the image of the integrated circuit that has to be printed on the wafer
Procedure
The following are the steps involved in creation of integrated circuits using lithography (Figure2):
Step 1: Coat the wafer with poly silicon liquid and place the photo resist layer on top of it.
Step 2: Expose the photoresist-coated wafer to proper radiation. Project a light on the mask containing the
pattern. Expose the light on the wafer with or without a mask. Some patterns on the mask are opaque and some
are transparent to the radiation falling on them, so when the light falls on the mask only those regions which are
transparent will allow the light to pass through it and fall on the wafer. Different resist have different properties.
Properties of only those resist will change which are exposed to proper radiation and later become soft or hard.
Step 3: Developing stage involves two areas:
Area 1: Photo resist becomes soft to radiation.
 Place the resist in a developer solution for easy detachment. Only that resist will remain which is not
yet exposed to radiation
