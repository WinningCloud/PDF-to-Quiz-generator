 Such types of computer evidences are important because quite often the evidence
becomes the deciding factor in a criminal, civil or employee dismissal action.
 Investigations involving trade secrets, commercial disputes and misdemeanor and
felony crimes can be won or lost solely with the introduction of recovered E- mail and other
documentation. If someone makes an attempt to delete, erase or otherwise hide critical
evidence, you need the competent data recovery capabilities of forensics discoveries.
 Computer users typically “Delete” incriminating or sensitive computer files(For e.g.,
using tools such as “Deep Freeze”, a software tool that is actually meant to protect
your computer) but the information may still exist in slack space on the computer’s
hard drive that is hidden.
 This computer data may linger (remain) for months or even years. However , it can
be recovered and documented using computer forensics methods and techniques.
 Unfortunately, there are many examples of computer usage in violation of computer
policy. Sexual harassment, theft of trade secrets, abuse of the internet and
unauthorized outside employment on company time are just few examples of violation
that warrant a forensics examination of a computer.
 Even in investigations where hard drives are reformatted in an attempt to hide
evidence, forensics discoveries can still potentially recover critical information.
 Forensics discoveries can also aid in recovering passwords for critical files that have
been maliciously set or changed.
⯈ There are further challenges; for example, many times, computer are
reissued when employees leave.
⯈ Computer that is used continuously may destroy the incriminating evidence that
can be used against a former disgruntled employee
⯈ Also, constant use of the computer may raise questions as to who created the
incriminating evidence and when
⯈ To prevent these problems and to preserve potentially valuable information, it is
recommended that a strict chain of custody should be followed and the subject
computer should be shut down, that is, the computer on which digital evidence is
believed to be residing
