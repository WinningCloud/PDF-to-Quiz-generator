4.2.1 Methods of Phishing,
Explain four types of methods used by the phishers to reveal personal
information on Internet

1. Dragnet
• A method involves the use of spammed E-Mails, bearing falsified corporate identification
(ne.., corporate names, logos and Customers of trademarks), which are addressed to a
large group of people ( a particular financial institution or members of a particular
auction site) to web- sites or pop-up windows with Similarly falsified identification.
• Dragnet phishers do not identify specific prospective victims in advance.
• Instead, they rely on false information included in an E-Mail to trigger an immediate
response by victims-typically, clicking on links in the body of the E-Mail to take the
victims to the websites or pop- up windows where they are requested to enter bank
or credit card account data or other personal data.
