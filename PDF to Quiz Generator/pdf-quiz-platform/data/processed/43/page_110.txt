4.3.3 Techniques of ID Theft
Human-based methods
 Direct access to information: People who have earned a certain degree of trust (ex.,
house cleaners, babysitters, nurse, friends or roommates) can obtain legitimate access to a
business or residence to steal information.
 Dumpster diving:
 Retrieving documents from trash bins is very common and is called dumpster
diving.
 Theft of a purse or wallet: Wallet often contains bank credit cards, debit cards,
driving licence medical insurance identity card and what not.
 Pickpockets work on the street as well as in public transport and exercise rooms
to steal the wallets and in turn sell the personal information.
 Mail theft and rerouting:
 It is easy to steal the postal mails from mailboxes, which has poor security mechanism
and all the documents available to the fraudster are free of charge, for example,
Bank Mail (credit cards and account statements), administrative forms or partially
completed credit offers.
 The fraudster can use your name and other information that may prove to be harmful
for an individual in the near future.
 Therefore, return items to the sender or request a change of address.
