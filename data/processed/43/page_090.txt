• 3. URLs that look right:
• The E-Mail might contain a URL (i.e., weblink) which seems to be legitimate website
wherein user can enter the information the phisher would like to steal.
• However, in reality the website will be a quickly cobbled copycat -a spoofed" website
that looks like the real thing, that is, legitimate website. In some cases, the link might
lead to selected pages of a legitimate website- such as the real company's actual
privacy policy or legal disclaimer.
• 4. Urgent messages:
• Creating a fear to trigger a response is very common in Phishing attacks – the E-
Mails warn that failure to respond will result in no longer having access to the
account or E-Mails might claim that organization has detected suspicious activity in
the users' account or that organization is implementing new privacy software for ID theft
solutions.
Here are a few examples of phrases used to entice the user to take the action.
• 1. Verity your account:
• The organization will never ask the user to send passwords, login names, permanent
account numbers (PANs) or SSNs and other personal information through E-Mail.
• For example, if you receive an E-Mail message from Microsoft asking you to update your
credit card Information, do not respond without any confirmation with Microsoft
authorities- this is a perfect example of Phishing attack.
• 2. You have won the lottery:
• The lottery scam is a common Phishing scam known as advanced fee fraud. One of
the most common forms of advanced fee fraud is a message that claims that you have
won a large sum of money, or that a person will pay you a large sum of money for
little or no work your part.
• The lottery scam often includes references to big companies, for example, Microsoft.
• There is no Microsoft lottery. It is observed that most of the phished E-Mails display
the agencies/companies situated in Great Britain and hence it is extremely important
for netizens to confirm/verify the authenticity of such E-Mails before sending any
response.
If " any-Mail is received displaying "You have won the lottery in Great Britain,"
confirm it on www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk
• If any E-Mail is received displaying your selection for any job into Great Britain,
confirm/verify the details of the organization on www.companieshouse.gov.uk
or on http://www.upmystreet. com/local/uk.html
• 3. If you don’t respond within 48 hours, your account will be closed
• These messages convey a sense of urgency so that you will respond immediately
without thinking. A Phishing E-Mail message might even claim that your response
is required because your account might have been compromised
Let us understand the ways to reduce the amount of Spam E-Mails we receive
• 1. Share personal Email address with limited people and/or on public websites-the more
exposed to the public, the more Spam E-Mails will be received.
• 2. Never reply or open any Spam E-Mails. Any spam E-Mails that are opened or
replied to inform the phishers not only about your existence but also about validity
of your E-Mail address.
• 3. Disguise the E-Mail address on public website or groups by spelling out the sign
"@” and the DOT for example, RajeevATgmailDOTcom. This usually prohibits
