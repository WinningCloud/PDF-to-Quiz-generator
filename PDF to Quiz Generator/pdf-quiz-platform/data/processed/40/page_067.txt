 Steganography is the practice of concealing (hiding) a file, message, image, or video within
another file, message, image, or video. The word steganography combines the Greek words
steganos , meaning "covered, concealed, or protected", and graphein meaning "writing".
 It is a method that attempts to hide the existence of a message or communication.
 Steganography is always misunderstood with cryptography
 The different names for steganography are data hiding, information hiding and digital
watermarking.
 Steganography can be used to make a digital watermark to detect illegal copying of
digital images. Thus, it aids confidentiality and integrity of the data.
 Digital watermarking is the process of possibly irreversibly embedding information into
a digital signal.
 The Digital signal may be, for example, audio, pictures or video.
