5. Identity theft and fraud: Phishers use the information that they have gathered to make
illegal purchases or commit fraud.
Nowadays, more and more organizations/institutes provide greater online access for their
customers and hence criminals are successfully using Phishing techniques to steal personal
information and conduct ID theft at a global level.
Password Cracking
 Password is like a key to get an entry into computerized systems like a lock.
 Password cracking is a process of recovering passwords from data that have been stored
in or transmitted by a computer system.
 Usually, an attacker follows a common approach – repeatedly making guesses for
the password.
The purpose of password cracking is as follows:
1. To recover a forgotten password.
2. As a preventive measure by system administrators to check for easily crackable
passwords.
3. To gain unauthorized access to a system.
Manual password cracking is to attempt to logon with different passwords. The attacker
follows the following steps:
1. Find a valid user account such as an Administrator or Guest;
2. create a list of possible passwords;
3. rank the passwords from high to low probability;
4. key-in each password;
5. try again until a successful password is found.
Passwords can be guessed sometimes with knowledge of the user’s personal
information. Examples of guessable passwords include:
1. Blank (none);
2. the words like “password,” “passcode” and “admin”;
3. series of letters from the “QWERTY” keyboard, for example, qwerty, asdf or
qwertyuiop;
4. user’s name or login name;
