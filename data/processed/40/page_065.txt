Trojan Horses and Backdoors
 Trojan Horse is a program in which malicious or harmful code is contained inside
apparently harmless programming or data in such a way that it can get control and cause
harm, for example, ruining the file allocation table on the hard disk.
 A Trojan Horse may get widely redistributed as part of a computer virus.
 The term Trojan Horse comes from Greek mythology about the Trojan War.
 Like Spyware and Adware, Trojans can get into the system in a number of ways, including
from a web browser, via E-Mail.
 It is possible that one could be forced to reformat USB flash drive or other portable device
to eliminate infection and avoid transferring it to other machines.
 Unlike viruses or worms, Trojans do not replicate themselves but they can be equally
destructive.
 On the surface, Trojans appear benign and harmless, but once the infected code is executed,
Trojans kick in and perform malicious functions to harm the computer system without the
user’s knowledge.
 For example, waterfalls.scr is a waterfall screen saver as originally claimed by the author;
however, it can be associated with malware and become a Trojan to unload hidden
programs and allow unauthorized access to the user’s PC.
Some typical examples of threats by Trojans are as follows:
1. They erase, overwrite or corrupt data on a computer.
2. They help to spread other malware such as viruses (by a dropper Trojan).
3. They deactivate or interfere with antivirus and firewall programs.
4. They allow remote access to your computer (by a remote access Trojan).
5. They upload and download files without your knowledge.
6. They gather E-Mail addresses and use them for Spam.
