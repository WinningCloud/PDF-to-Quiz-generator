1. Elevated user access-Any data processed outside the organization brings with it
an inherent level of risk
2. Regulatory compliance-Cloud computing service providers are not able and/or not
willing to undergo external assessments.
3. Location of the data-User doesn’t know where the data is stored or in which
country it is hosted.
4. Segregation of data-Data of one organization is scattered in different locations
5. Recovery of the data-In case of any disaster, availability of the services and data
is critical.
6. Information security- violation reports Due to complex IT environment and
several customers logging in and logging out of the hosts, it becomes difficult to
trace inappropriate and/or illegal activity
7. Long-term viability- In case of any major change in the cloud computing service
provider (e.g., acquisition and merger, partnership breakage), the service provided
is at the stake.
