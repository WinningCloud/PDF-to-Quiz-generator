Keyloggers and Spywares
 Keystroke logging, often called keylogging, is the practice of noting (or logging) the keys
struck on a keyboard, typically in a covert manner so that the person using the keyboard is
unaware that such actions are being monitored.
 Keystroke logger or keylogger is quicker and easier way of capturing the passwords and
monitoring the victims’ IT savvy behavior. It can be classified as software keylogger and
hardware keylogger.
Software Keyloggers
 Software keyloggers are software programs installed on the computer systems which
usually are located between the OS and the keyboard hardware, and every keystroke is
recorded.
 Software keyloggers are installed on a computer system by Trojans or viruses without the
knowledge of the user.
 Cybercriminals always install such tools on the insecure computer systems available in
public places (i.e., cybercafés, etc) and can obtain the required information about the victim
very easily.
 A keylogger usually consists of two files that get installed in the same directory: a dynamic
link library (DLL) file and an EXEcutable (EXE) file that installs the DLL file and triggers
it to work. DLL does all the recording of keystrokes.
Some Important Keyloggers are as follows
All In One Keylogger Stealth Keylogger Perfect Keylogger
KGB Spy Spy Buddy Elite Keylogger
CyberSpy Powered Keylogger
Hardware Keyloggers
 Hardware keyloggers are small hardware devices.
 These are connected to the PC and/or to the keyboard and save every keystroke into a file
or in the memory of the hardware device.
 Cybercriminals install such devices on ATM machines to capture ATM Cards’ PINs.
 Each keypress on the keyboard of the ATM gets registered by these keyloggers.
 These keyloggers look like an integrated part of such systems; hence, bank customers are
unaware of their presence.
