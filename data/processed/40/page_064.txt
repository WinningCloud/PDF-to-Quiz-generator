 Worms and Trojans, such as viruses, may harm the system’s data or performance.
 Some viruses and other malware have noticeable symptoms that enable computer user to
take necessary corrective actions, but many viruses are surreptitious or simply do nothing
for user’s to take note of them.
 Some viruses do nothing beyond reproducing themselves.
Types of Viruses
1. Boot sector viruses: It infects the storage media on which OS is stored (e.g., hard drives)
and which is used to start the computer system.
2. Program viruses: These viruses become active when the program file (usually with
extensions .bin, .com,.exe, .ovl, .drv) is excuted
3. Multipartite viruses: It is a hybrid of a boot sector and program viruses. It infects program
files along with the boot record when the infected program is active.
4. Stealth viruses: It hides itself and so detecting this type of virus is very difficult. It can
hiding itself such a way that antivirus software also cannot detect it. Example for Stealth
virus is “Brain Virus”.
5. Polymorphic viruses: It acts like a “chameleon” that changes its virus signature (i.e.,
binary pattern) every time it spreads through the system (i.e., multiplies and infects a new
file). Hence, it is always difficult to detect polymorphic virus with the help of an antivirus
program.
6. Macro viruses: Many applications, such as Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel, support
MACROs (i.e., macrolanguages). These macros are programmed as a macro embedded in
a document. Once macrovirus gets onto a victim’s computer then every document he/she
produces will become infected.
7. Active X and Java Control: All the web browsers have settings about Active X and Java
Controls.
