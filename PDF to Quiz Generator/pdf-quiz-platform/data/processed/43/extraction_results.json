Any illegal act where a special knowledge of computer technology is essential for its perpetration (to\ncommit a crime), investigation or prosecution.\n2.

Any threats to the computer itself, such as theft of hardware or software, damage and demands for\nmoney.\n5. “Cybercrime (computer crime) is any illegal behavior, directed by means of electronic operations, that\ntargets the security of computer systems and the data processed by them.”\nNote that in a wider sense, “computer-related crime” can be any illegal behavior committed by means of, or\nin relation to, a computer system or network; however, this is not cybercrime. The term “cybercrime” relates to\na number of other terms that may sometimes be used to describe crimes committed using computers.\n• Computer-related crime\n• Computer crime\n• Internet crime\n• E-crime\n• High-tech crime, etc. are the other synonymous terms.\nCybercrime specifically can be defined in a number of ways; a few definitions are:\n1. A crime committed using a computer and the Internet to steal a person’s identity (identity theft) or sell\ncontraband or stalk victims or disrupt operations with malevolent programs.\n2. Crimes completed either on or with a computer.\n3. Any illegal activity done through the Internet or on the computer.\n4. All criminal activities done using the medium of computers, the Internet, cyberspace and the WWW.\nAccording to one information security, cybercrime is any criminal activity which uses network access to\ncommit a criminal act. Cybercrime may be internal or external, with the former easier to perpetrate. The term\n“cybercrime” has evolved over the past few years since the adoption of Internet connection on a global scale with\nhundreds of millions of users. Cybercrime refers to the act of performing a criminal act using cyberspaceas the\ncommunications vehicle.\nSome people argue that a cybercrime is not a crime as it is a crime against software & not against a person (or)\nproperty. However, while the legal systems around the world scramble to introduce laws to combat cyber criminals,\n2 types of attacks are prevalent:\n1. Techno-crime: A premeditated act against a system or systems, with the intent to copy, steal, prevent access,\ncorrupt or otherwise deface or damage parts of or the complete computer system. The 24X7 connection to\nthe internet makes this type of cybercrime a real possibility to engineer from anywhere in the world, leaving\nJ yothi R, Assistant Professor, Dept.of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) 5",

Techno-vandalism: These acts of “brainless” defacement of websites and/or other activities, such as copying\nfiles and publicizing their contents publicly, are usually opportunistic in nature. Tight internal security,\nallied to strong technical safeguards should prevent the vast majority of such incidents.\nThere is a very thin line between the two terms “computer crime” and “computer fraud”; both are\npunishable. Cybercrimes (harmful acts committed from or against a computer or network) differ from most\nterrestrial crimes in four ways:\na. how to commit them is easier to learn,\nb. they require few resources relative to the potential damage caused,\nc. they can be committed in a jurisdiction without being physically present in it &\nd. they are often not clearly illegal.\nImportant Definitions related to Cyber Security:\nCyberterrorism:\nThis term was coined in 1997 by Barry Collin, a senior research fellow at the institute for Security and\nIntelligence in California. Cyberterrorism seems to be a controversial term. The use of information technology and\nmeans by terrorist groups & agents is called as Cyberterrorism.\n“The premeditated use of disruptive activities, or the threat thereof, against computers and/or networks,\nwith the intention to cause harm or further social, ideological, religious, political or similar objectives or to\nintimidate any person in furtherance of such objectives.”\n(or)\nCyberterrorism is defined as “any person, group or organization who, with terrorist intent, utilizesaccesses\nor aids in accessing a computer or computer network or electronic system or electronic device by any available\nmeans, and thereby knowingly engages in or attempts to engage in a terrorist act commits the offence of\ncyberterrorism.”\nCybernetics:\nCybernetics deals with information and its use. Cybernetics is the science that overlaps the fields of\nneurophysiology, information theory, computing machinery and automation. Worldwide, including India,\ncyberterrorists usually use computer as a tool, target for their unlawful act to gain information.\nInternet is one of the means by which the offenders can gain priced sensitive information of companies,\nJ yothi R, Assistant Professor, Dept.of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) 6",

The goal is to trick the email recipient into\nbelieving that the message is something they want or need a request from their bank, for instance, or a note from\nsomeone in their company and to click a link or download an attachment.\nPhishing is an attempt by an individual or a group to thieve personal confidential information such as\npasswords, credit card information from unsuspecting victims for identity theft, financial gain &amp; other\nfraudulent activities.\n(or)\nPhishing is a form of online identity theft that aims to steal sensitive information such as online banking\npasswords, credit card information from users etc.\nCyberspace:\nThis is a term coined by William Gibson, a science fiction writer in 1984. Cyberspace is where users\nmentally travel through matrices of data. Conceptually, cyberspace is the nebulous place where humans interact\nover computer networks. The term “cyberspace” is now used to describe the Internet and other computernetworks.\nIn terms of computer science, “cyberspace” is a worldwide network of computer networks that uses the\nTransmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) for communication to facilitate transmission and\nexchange of data. Cyberspace is most definitely a place where you chat, explore, research and play.\nCybersquatting:\nThe term is derived from “squatting” which is the act of occupying an abandoned/unoccupied space/\nbuilding that the user does not own, rent or otherwise have permission to use. Cybersquatting, however, is a bit\ndifferent in that the domain names that are being squatted are (sometimes but not always) being paid for by the\ncybersquatters through the registration process.\nCybersquatters usually ask for prices far greater than those at which they purchased it. Some cybersquatters\nput up derogatory or defamatory remarks about the person or company the domain is meant to represent in an\neffort to encourage the subject to buy the domain from them. This term is explained herebecause, in a way,\nit relates to cybercrime given the intent of cybersquatting.\nJ yothi R, Assistant Professor, Dept.of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) 7",

      "text": "Cybersquatting means registering, selling or using a domain name with the intent of profiting from the\ngoodwill of someone else’s trademark. In this nature, it can be considered to be a type of cybercrime.\nCybersquatting is the practice of buying “domain names” that have existing businesses names.\nIn India, Cybersquatting is considered to be an Intellectual Property Right (IPR). In India, Cybersquatting\nis seen to interfere with “Uniform Dispute Resolution Policy” (a contractual obligation to which all domain name\nregistrants are presently subjected to).\nCyberpunk:\nThis is a term coined by Bruce Bethke, published in science fiction stories magazine in November 1983.\nAccording to science fiction literature, the words “cyber” and “punk” emphasize the two basic aspects of\ncyberpunk: “technology” and “individualism.” The term “cyberpunk” could mean something like “anarchy\nvia machines” or “machine/computer rebel movement.”\nCyberwarfare:\nCyberwarfare means information attacks against an unsuspecting opponent’s computer networks,\ndestroying and paralyzing nations. This perception seems to be correct as the terms cyberwarfare and\nCyberterrorism have got historical connection in the context of attacks against infrastructure. The term “information\ninfrastructure” refers to information resources, including communication systems that support an industry,\ninstitution or population. These type of Cyber attacks are often presented as threat to military forcesand the\nInternet has major implications for espionage and warfare.\nCYBERCRIME AND INFORMATION SECURITY\nLack of information security gives rise to cybercrimes. Let us refer to the amended Indian Information\nTechnology Act (ITA) 2000 in the context of cybercrime. From an Indian perspective, the new version of the Act\n(referred to as ITA 2008) provides a new focus on “Information Security in India\". \"Cybersecurity” means\nprotecting information, equipment, devices, computer, computer resource, communication device and information\nstored therein from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification or destruction.The term\nincorporates both the physical security of devices as well as the information stored therein. It covers protection\nfrom unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification and destruction.\nWhere financial losses to the organization due to insider crimes are concerned (e.g., leaking customer data),\nJ yothi R, Assistant Professor, Dept.of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) 8",

      "text": "often some difficulty is faced in estimating the losses because the financial impacts may not be detectedby the\nvictimized organization and no direct costs may be associated with the data theft. The 2008 CSI Surveyon\ncomputer crime and security supports this. Cybercrimes occupy an important space in information security domain\nbecause of their impact. The other challenge comes from the difficulty in attaching a quantifiable monetary value\nto the corporate data and yet corporate data get stolen/lost (through loss/theft of laptops).\nBecause of these reasons, reporting of financial losses often remains approximate. In an attempt to avoid\nnegative publicity, most organizations abstain from revealing facts and figures about “security incidents” including\ncybercrime. In general, organizations perception about “insider attacks” seems to be different thanthat made\nout by security solution vendor. However, this perception of an organization does not seem to be trueas revealed\nby the 2008 CSI Survey. Awareness about “data privacy” too tends to be low in most organizations. When we\nspeak of financial losses to the organization and significant insider crimes, such as leaking customer data, such\n“crimes” may not be detected by the victimized organization and no direct costs may be associated with the theft\nFigure: Cybercrime trend over the years\nJ yothi R, Assistant Professor, Dept.of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) 9",

For example, let us say, Roopa has an E-Mail address roopa@asianlaws.org. Let us\nsay her boyfriend Suresh and she happen to have a show down. Then Suresh, having become her enemy, spoofs\nher E-Mail and sends vulgar messages to all her acquaintances. Since the E-Mails appear to have originated\nfrom Roopa, her friends could take offense and relationships could be spoiled for life.\n2. Online Frauds: The most common types of online fraud are called phishing and spoofing. Phishing is the\nprocess of collecting your personal information through e-mails or websites claiming to be legitimate. This\ninformation can include usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, social security numbers, etc. Often times the\ne-mails directs you to a website where you can update your personal information. Because these sites often look\n“official,” they hope you’ll be tricked into disclosing valuable information that you normally would not reveal.\nThis often times, results in identity theft and financial loss.\nSpyware and viruses are both malicious programs that are loaded onto your computer without your\nknowledge. The purpose of these programs may be to capture or destroy information, to ruin computer performance\nor to overload you with advertising. Viruses can spread by infecting computers and then replicating. Spyware\ndisguises itself as a legitimate application and embeds itself into your computer where it then monitors your activity\nand collects information.\n3. Phishing, Spear Phishing and its various other forms such as Vishing and Smishing:\nPhishing is the process of collecting your personal information through e-mails or websites claiming to be\nlegitimate. This information can include usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, social security numbers, etc.\nOften times the e-mails directs you to a website where you can update your personal information. Because these\nsites often look “official,” they hope you’ll be tricked into disclosing valuable information that you normally\nwould not reveal. This often times, results in identity theft and financial loss.\nSpear Phishing is a method of sending a Phishing message to a particular organization to gain organizational\ninformation for more targeted social engineering. Here is how Spear Phishing scams work; Spear Phishing\ndescribes any highly targeted Phishing attack. Spear phishers send E-Mail that appears genuine to all the\nemployees or members within a certain company, government agency, organization or group. The message might\nlook as if it has come from your employer, or from a colleague who might send an E-Mail message to everyone in\nthe company; it could include requests for usernames or passwords. While traditional Phishingscams are\ndesigned to steal information from individuals, spear phishing scam works to gain access to acompany's entire\ncomputer system.\nJ yothi R, Assistant Professor, Dept.of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) 14",

If you don’t pick up, then they’ll leave a voicemail message asking you to\ncall back. Sometimes these kinds of scams will employ an answering service or even a call center that’s unaware\nof the crime being perpetrated.\nOnce again, the aim is to get credit card details, birthdates, account sign-ins, or sometimes just to harvest\nphone numbers from your contacts. If you respond and call back, there may be an automated message\nprompting you to hand over data and many people won’t question this, because they accept automated phone\nsystems as part of daily life now.\nSmishing (SMS phishing) is a type of phishing attack conducted using SMS (Short Message Services) on\ncell phones. Just like email phishing scams, smishing messages typically include a threat or enticement to\nclick a link or call a number and hand over sensitive information. Sometimes they might suggest you install some\nsecurity software, which turns out to be malware.\nSmishing example: A typical smishing text message might say something along the lines of, “Your ABC\nBank account has been suspended. To unlock your account, tap here: https://bit.ly/2LPLdaU” and thelink\nprovided will download malware onto your phone. Scammers are also adept at adjusting to the medium\nthey’re using, so you might get a text message that says, “Is this really a pic of you? https://bit.ly/2LPLdaU” and\nif you tap that link to find out, once again you’re downloading malware.\n4. Spamming: People who create electronic Spam are called spammers. Spam is the abuse of electronicmessaging\nsystems (including most broadcast media, digital delivery systems) to send unrequested bulk messages\nindiscriminately. Although the most widely recognized form of Spam is E-Mail Spam, the term is applied to similar\nabuses in other media: instant messaging Spam, Usenet newsgroup Spam, web search engine Spam, Spam in blogs,\nwiki Spam, online classified ads Spam, mobile phone messaging Spam, Internet forum Spam, junk fax\ntransmissions, social networking Spam, file sharing network Spam, video sharing sites, etc.\nSpamming is difficult to control because it has economic viability – advertisers have no operating costs\nbeyond the management of their mailing lists, and it is difficult to hold senders accountable for their mass mailings.\nSpammers are numerous; the volume of unrequested mail has become very high because the barrier to entry is low.\nTherefore, the following web publishing techniques should be avoided:\n Repeating keywords;\n use of keywords that do not relate to the content on the site;\nJ yothi R, Assistant Professor, Dept.of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) 15",

Cyber defamation: It is a cognizable (Software) offense. “Whoever, by words either spoken or intended to be\nread, or by signs or by visible representations, makes or publishes any imputation concerning any person intending\nto harm, or knowing or having reason to believe that such imputation will harm, the reputation ofsuch person,\nis said, except in the cases hereinafter expected, to defame that person.”\nCyber defamation happens when the above takes place in an electronic form. In other words, cyber\ndefamation occurs when defamation takes place with the help of computers and/or the Internet. For example,\nsomeone publishes defamatory matter about someone on a website or sends an E-Mail containing defamatory\ninformation to all friends of that person.\n6. Cyberstalking and harassment: The dictionary meaning of “stalking” is an “act or process of following prey\nstealthily – trying to approach somebody or something.” Cyberstalking has been defined as the use of information\nand communications technology, particularly the Internet, by an individual or group of individualsto harass\nanother individual, group of individuals, or organization. The behavior includes false accusations, monitoring,\ntransmission of threats, ID theft, damage to data or equipment, solicitation of minors for sexual purposes, and\ngathering information for harassment purposes.\nAs the internet has become an integral part of our personal & professional lives, cyberstalkers take advantage of\nease of communication & an increased access to personal information available with a few mouse clicks or\nkeystrokes. They are 2 types of stalkers: Online Stalkers: aim to start the interaction with the victim directly\nwith the help of the internet. Offline Stalkers: the stalker may begin the attack using traditional methods such\nas following the victim, watching the daily routine of the victim.\n7. Computer Sabotage: The use of the Internet to stop the normal functioning of a computer system through the\nintroduction of worms, viruses or logic bombs, is referred to as computer sabotage. It can be used to gain economic\nadvantage over a competitor, to promote the illegal activities of terrorists or to steal data or programs for extortion\npurposes.

Any photograph that can be considered obscene and/or unsuitable for the age of child viewer;\n2. film, video, picture;\n3. computer-generated image or picture of sexually explicit conduct where the production of such visual\ndepiction involves the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.\nChild Pornography is considered an offense. The internet is being highly used by its abusers to reach and abuse\nchildren sexually, worldwide. The Internet has become a household commodity in the urban areas of the nation. Its\nexplosion has made the children a viable victim to the cybercrime. As the broad-band connections get intothe\nreach of more and more homes, larger child population will be using the Internet and therefore greaterwould\nbe the chances of falling victim to the aggression of pedophiles. Pedophiles are the people who physically or\npsychologically coerce minors to engage in sexual activities, which the minors would not consciously consent too.\nHere is how pedophiles operate:\n Step 1: Pedophiles use a false identity to trap the children/teenagers.\n Step 2: They seek children/teens in the kids’ areas on the services, such as the Games BB or chat areas\nwhere the children gather.\n Step 3: They befriend children/teens.\n Step 4: They extract personal information from the child/teen by winning his/her confidence.\n Step 5: Pedophiles get E-Mail address of the child/teen and start making contacts on the victim’s E-Mail\naddress as well. Sometimes, these E-Mails contain sexually explicit language.\n Step 6: They start sending pornographic images/text to the victim including child pornographic images\nin order to help child/teen shed his/her inhibitions so that a feeling is created in the mind of the victim\nthat what is being fed to him is normal and that everybody does it.\n Step 7: At the end of it, the pedophiles set up a meeting with the child/teen out of the house and then\ndrag him/her into the net to further sexually assault him/her or to use him/her as a sex object.\n9. Password Sniffing: is a hacking technique that uses a special software application that allows a hacker to steal\nusernames and passwords simply by observing and passively recording network traffic. This often happens on\npublic WiFi networks where it is relatively easy to spy on weak or unencrypted traffic.\nAnd yet, password sniffers aren’t always used for malicious intent.

Credit Card Frauds: Credit card fraud is an inclusive term for fraud committed using a payment card, such\nas a credit card or debit card. The purpose may be to obtain goods or services, or to make payment to another\naccount which is controlled by a criminal. The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is\nthe data security standard created to help businesses process card payments securely and reduce\ncard fraud. Credit card fraud can be authorised, where the genuine customer themselves processes a payment\nto another account which is controlled by a criminal, or unauthorised, where the account holder does not\nprovide authorisation for the payment to proceed and the transaction is carried out by a third party.\nCredit cards are more secure than ever, with regulators, card providers and banks taking\nconsiderable time and effort to collaborate with investigators worldwide to ensure fraudsters aren't successful.\nCardholders' money is usually protected from scammers with regulations that make the card provider and bank\naccountable. The technology and security measures behind credit cards are becoming increasingly sophisticated\nmaking it harder for fraudsters to steal money.\n2. Intellectual Property (IP) Crimes: With the growth in the use of internet these days the cyber crimes are also\ngrowing. Cyber theft of Intellectual Property (IP) is one of them. Cyber theft of IP means stealing of copyrights,\nsoftware piracy, trade secrets, patents etc., using internet and computers.\nCopyrights and trade secrets are the two forms of IP that is frequently stolen. For example,\nstealing of software, business strategies etc. Generally, the stolen material is sold to the rivals or others for\nfurther sale of the product. This may result in the huge loss to the company who originally created it.\nAnother major cyber theft of IP faced by India is piracy. These days one can get pirated version of movies,\nsoftware etc. The piracy results in a huge loss of revenue to the copyright holder. It is difficult to find the cyber\nthieves and punish them because everything they do is over internet, so they erase the data immediately and\ndisappear within fraction of a second.\n Internet time theft: Such a theft occurs when an unauthorized person uses the Internet hours paid for by another\nperson. Basically, Internet time theft comes under hacking because the person who gets access to someone\nelse’s ISP user ID and password, either by hacking or by gaining access to it by illegal means,uses it to\nJ yothi R, Assistant Professor, Dept.of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) 18",

The issue of Internet\ntime theft is related to the crimes conducted through identity theft.\nCybercrime against Organization\n1. Unauthorized accessing of Computer: Hacking is one method of doing this and hacking is punishable\noffense. Unauthorized computer access, popularly referred to as hacking, describes a criminal action whereby\nsomeone uses a computer to knowingly gain access to data in a system without permission toaccess that\ndata.\n2. Password Sniffing: Password Sniffers are programs that monitor and record the name and password of\nnetwork users as they login, jeopardizing security at a site. Whoever installs the Sniffer can then impersonate\nan authorized user and login to access restricted documents. Laws are not yet set up to\nadequately prosecute a person for impersonating another person online. Laws designed to prevent\nunauthorized access to information may be effective in apprehending crackers using Sniffer programs.\n3. Denial-of-service Attacks (DoS Attacks): It is an attempt to make a computer resource (i.e.., information\nsystems) unavailable to its intended users. In this type of criminal act, the attacker floods the bandwidth of the\nvictim’s network or fills his E-Mail box with spam mail depriving him of the services he is entitled to access\nor provide. The goal of DoS is not to gain unauthorized access to systems or data, but to prevent intended users\n(i.e., legitimate users) of a service from using it. A DoS attack may do the following:\na. Flood a network with traffic, thereby preventing legitimate network traffic.\nb. Disrupt connections between two systems, thereby preventing access to a service.\nc. Prevent a particular individual from accessing a service.\nd. Disrupt service to a specifi c system or person.\n4. Virus attacks/dissemination of Viruses:\nComputer virus is a program that can “infect” legitimate (valid) programs by modifying them to include a\npossibly “evolved” copy of itself. Viruses spread themselves, without the knowledge or permission of the\nusers, to potentially large numbers of programs on many machines. A computer virus passes from computer\nto computer in a similar manner as a biological virus passes from person to person. Viruses may also contain\nmalicious instructions that may cause damage or annoyance; the combination of possibly Malicious Code with\nthe ability to spread is what makes viruses a considerable concern. Viruses can often spread without any readily\nvisible symptoms.

E-Mail bombing/Mail bombs: E-Mail bombing refers to sending a large number of E-Mails to the victim\nto crash victim’s E-Mail account (in the case of an individual) or to make victim’s mail servers crash (in\nthe case of a company or an E-Mail service provider). Computer program can be written to instruct a computer\nto do such tasks on a repeated basis. In recent times, terrorism has hit the Internet in the form of mail bombings.\nBy instructing a computer to repeatedly send E-Mail to a specified person’s E-Mail address, the cybercriminal\ncan overwhelm the recipient’s personal account and potentially shut down entire systems. This may or may\nnot be illegal, but it is certainly disruptive.\n6. Salami Attack/Salami technique: These attacks are used for committing financial crimes. The idea here is to\nmake the alteration so insignificant that in a single case it would go completely unnoticed; For example a bank\nemployee inserts a program, into the bank’s servers, that deducts a small amount of money (say Rs.2/- or\na few cents in a month) from the account of every customer. No account holder will probably notice this\nunauthorized debit, but the bank employee will make a sizable amount every month.\n7. Logic Bomb: A Logic Bomb is a piece of often-malicious code that is intentionally inserted into software.\nIt is activated upon the host network only when certain conditions are met. Some viruses may be termed as\nlogic bombs because they lie dormant all through the year and become active only on a particular date.\n8. Trojan Horse: A Trojan Horse, Trojan for short, is a term used to describe malware that appears, to the user,\nto perform a desirable function but, in fact, facilitates unauthorized access to the user’s computer system.\n9. Data Diddling: A data diddling (data cheating) attack involves altering raw data just before it is processed\nby a computer and then changing it back after the processing is completed. Electricity Boards in India have\nbeen victims to data diddling programs inserted when private parties computerize their systems.\n10. Newsgroup Spam/Crimes emanating from Usenet newsgroup: This is one form of spamming. The word\n“Spam” was usually taken to mean Excessive Multiple Posting (EMP). The advent of Google Groups, and its\nlarge Usenet archive, has made Usenet more attractive to spammers than ever. Spamming of Usenet\nnewsgroups actually predates E-Mail Spam.\n11.

Industrial spying is not new; in fact it is as old as\nindustries themselves. The use of the Internet to achieve this is probably as old as the Internet itself.\nTraditionally, this has been the reserved hunting field of a few hundreds of highly skilled hackers, contracted\nby high-profile companies or certain governments via the means of registered organizations (it is said that\nthey get several hundreds of thousands of dollars, depending on the “assignment”). With the growing public\navailability of Trojans and Spyware material, even low-skilled individuals are now inclinedto generate high\nvolume profit out of industrial spying. This is referred to as “Targeted Attacks” (which includes “Spear\nPhishing”).\n12. Computer network intrusions: “Crackers” who are often misnamed “Hackers can break into computer\nsystems from anywhere in the world and steal data, plant viruses, create backdoors, insert Trojan Horses or\nchange user names and passwords. Network intrusions are illegal, but detection and enforcement are\ndifficult. Current laws are limited and many intrusions go undetected. The cracker can bypass existing\npassword protection by creating a program to capture logon IDs and passwords. The practice of “strong\npassword” is therefore important.\n13. Software piracy: This is a big challenge area indeed. Cybercrime investigation cell of India defines“software\npiracy” as theft of software through the illegal copying of genuine programs or the counterfeiting and\ndistribution of products intended to pass for the original. There are many examples of software piracy:\n1. end-user copying: friends loaning disks to each other, or organizations under-reporting the number\nof software installations they have made, or organizations not tracking their software licenses;\n2. hard disk loading with illicit means: hard disk vendors load pirated software;\n3. counterfeiting: large-scale duplication and distribution of illegally copied software;\n4. Illegal downloads from the Internet: by intrusion, by cracking serial numbers, etc. Beware that\nthose who buy pirated software have a lot to lose:\n getting untested software that may have been copied thousands of times over,\n the software, if pirated, may potentially contain hard-drive-infecting viruses,\n there is no technical support in the case of software failure, that is, lack of technical\nproduct support available to properly licensed users,\n there is no warranty protection,\nJ yothi R, Assistant Professor, Dept.of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) 21",

Forgery: Counterfeit currency notes, postage and revenue stamps, marksheets, etc. can be forged using\nsophisticated computers, printers and scanners. Outside many colleges there are miscreants soliciting the sale\nof fake mark-sheets or even degree certificates. These are made using computers and high quality scanners and\nprinters. In fact, this is becoming a booming business involving large monetary amount givento student gangs\nin exchange for these bogus but authentic looking certificates.\n2. Cyberterrorism: Cyberterrorism is a controversial term. Cyberterrorism is the use of the Internet to conduct\nviolent acts that result in, or threaten, loss of life or significant bodily harm, in order to achieve political or\nideological gains through threat or intimidation. It is also sometimes considered an act ofInternet terrorism\nwhere terrorist activities, including acts of deliberate, large-scale disruption of computer networks, especially\nof personal computers attached to the Internet by means of tools such as computer viruses, computer worms,\nphishing, and other malicious software and hardware methods and programming scripts.\n3. Web Jacking: Web jacking occurs when someone forcefully takes control of a website (by cracking the\npassword and later changing it). Thus, the first stage of this crime involves “password sniffing”. The actual\nowner of the website does not have any more control over what appears on that website.\nCrimes emanating from Usenet newsgroup:\nBy its very nature, Usenet groups may carry very offensive, harmful, inaccurate or otherwise inappropriate\nmaterial, or in some cases, postings that have been mislabeled or are deceptive in another way. Therefore, it is\nexpected that you will use caution and common sense and exercise proper judgment when using Usenet, as well as\nuse the service at your own risk.\nUsenet is a popular means of sharing and distributing information on the Web with respect to specific topic\nor subjects. Usenet is a mechanism that allows sharing information in a many-to-many manner.

      "text": "CYBERCRIME: THE LEGAL PERSPECTIVES\n Cybercrime poses a biggest challenge.\n Computer Crime: As per “Criminal Justice Resource Manual (1979)”, computer-related crime was defined\nin the broader meaning as: “any illegal act for which knowledge of computer technology is essential for a\nsuccessful prosecution”.\n International legal aspects of computer crimes were studied in 1983.\n In that study, computer crime was consequently defined as: “encompasses any illegal act for which\nknowledge of computer technology is essential for its commit”.\n Cybercrime, in a way, is the outcome of “globalization.” However, globalization does not mean\nglobalized welfare at all.\n Globalized information systems accommodate an increasing number of transnational offenses.\n The network context of cybercrime makes it one of the most globalized offenses of the present and the\nmost modernized threats of the future.\n This problem can be resolved in two ways.\na) One is to divide information systems into segments bordered by state boundaries (cross-border\nflow of information).\nb) The other is to incorporate the legal system into an integrated entity obliterating these state\nboundaries.\n Apparently, the first way is unrealistic. Although all ancient empires including Rome, Greece and Mongolia\nbecame historical remnants, and giant empires are not prevalent in current world, the partitionof\ninformation systems cannot be an imagined practice.\n In a globally connected world, information systems become the unique empire without tangible territory.\nCYBERCRIMES: AN INDIAN PERSPECTIVE\nIndia has the fourth highest number of Internet users in the world. According to the statistics posted on the\nsite (http://www.iamai.in/), there are 45 million Internet users in India, 37% of all Internet accesses happen from\ncybercafés and 57% of Indian Internet users are between 18 and 35 years. The population of educatedyouth\nis high in India. It is reported that compared to the year 2006, cybercrime under the Information Technology (IT)\nAct recorded a whopping 50% increase in the year 2007. A point to note is that the majority of offenders were\nunder 30 years. The maximum cybercrime cases, about 46%, were related to incidents of\ncyberpornography, followed by hacking. In over 60% of these cases, offenders were between 18 and 30 years,\nJ yothi R, Assistant Professor, Dept.of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) 23",

There were 76 cases of hacking with computer system which is related to loss/damage of\ncomputer resource/utility. India is said to be “youth country” given the population age distribution. However from\ncybercrime perspective, this youth aspect does not seem good as revealed by cybercrime statistics in India.\nCybercrimes: Cases of various categories under IPC Section: A total of 339 cases were registered under IPC\nsections during the year 2007 as compared to 311 such cases during 2006, thereby reporting an increase of\n9%.Majority of the crimes out of total 339 cases registered under IPC fall under 2 categories i.e.., Forgery &\nCriminal breach of Trust or Fraud.\nIncidence of Cybercrimes in cities: 17 out of 35 mega cities did not report any case of cybercrime (neither under\nthe IT Act nor under IPC Sections) during the year 2007. A total of 17 mega cities have reported 118 cases under\nIT Act and 7 mega cities reported 180 cases under various sections of IPC.\nThe Indian Government is doing its best to control cybercrimes. For example, Delhi Police have now trained\n100 of its officers in handling cybercrime and placed them in its Economic Offences Wing. As at the time of\nwriting this, the officers were trained for 6 weeks in computer hardware and software, computer\nnetworks comprising data communication networks, network protocols, wireless networks and network security.\nCYBERCRIME & THE INDIAN ITA 2000\nIn India, the ITA 2000 was enacted after the United Nation General Assembly ResolutionA/RES/51/162\nin January 30, 1997 by adopting the Model Law on Electronic Commerce adopted by the United Nations\nCommission on International Trade Law. This was the first step toward the Law relating to E- Commerce at\ninternational level to regulate an alternative form of commerce and to give legal status in the areaof E-Commerce.\nIt was enacted taking into consideration UNICITRAL model of Law on Electronic Commerce (1996).\nJ yothi R, Assistant Professor, Dept.of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) 24",

However, a broad meaning is given to cybercrime at an international\nlevel. In the Council of Europe’s (CoE’s) Cyber Crime Treaty, cybercrime is used as an umbrella term to refer to\nan array of criminal activity including offenses against computer data and systems, computer- related offenses,\ncontent offenses and copyright offenses.\nThis wide definition of cybercrime overlaps in part with general offense categories that need not be\nInformation & Communication Technology (ICT)-dependent, such as white-collar crime and economic crime.\nAlthough this status is from the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) survey conducted in 2005, we get\nan idea about the global perspective. ITU activities on countering Spam can be read by visiting the link\nwww.itu.int/spam (8 May 2010). The Spam legislation scenario mentions “none” about India as far as E-Mail\nlegislation in India is concerned.\nThe linkage of cybersecurity and critical infrastructure protection has become a big issue as a number of\ncountries have began assessment of threats, vulnerabilities and started exploring mechanisms to redress them.\nRecently, there have been a number of significant developments such as\n1. August 4, 2006 Announcement: The US Senate ratifies CoE Convention on Cyber Crime. The convention\ntargets hackers, those spreading destructive computer viruses, those using the Internet for the sexual\nexploitation of children or the distribution of racist material, and terrorists attempting to attack infrastructure\nfacilities or financial institutions. The Convention is in full accord with all the US\nconstitutional protections, such as free speech and other civil liberties, and will require no change to the US\nlaws.\n2. In August 18, 2006, there was a news article published “ISPs Wary About ‘Drastic Obligations’ on Web\nSite Blocking.” European Union (EU) officials want to debar suspicious websites as part of a 6-point\nplan to boost joint antiterrorism activities. They want to block websites that incite terrorist action.

More than 40 countries have ratified the Convention to date.\nCybercrime and the Extended Enterprise:\nIt is a continuing problem that the average user is not adequately educated to understand the threats and\nhow to protect oneself. Actually, it is the responsibility of each user to become aware of the threats as well asthe\nopportunities that “connectivity” and “mobility” presents them with. In this context, it is important to understand\nthe concept of “extended enterprise.” This term represents the concept that a company is made upnot just of\nits employees, its board members and executives, but also its business partners, its suppliers and even its customers.\nFigure: Extended Enterprise\nThe extended enterprise can only be successful if all of the component groups and individuals have the\ninformation they need in order to do business effectively. An extended enterprise is a “loosely coupled, self-\norganizing network” of firms that combine their economic output to provide “products and services” offerings\nto the market. Firms in the extended enterprise may operate independently. Seamless flow of “information” to\nsupport instantaneous “decision-making ability” is crucial for the “external enterprise”. This becomes possible\nthrough the “interconnectedness”. Due to the interconnected features of information & communication\ntechnologies, security overall can only be fully promoted when the users have full awareness of existing threats\n& dangers.\nGiven the promises and challenges in the extended enterprise scenario, organizations in the international\ncommunity have a special role in sharing information on good practices and creating open and accessible enterprise\ninformation flow channels for exchanging of ideas in a collaborative manner.\nJ yothi R, Assistant Professor, Dept.of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) 27",

Typically, the term “cracker” is used within the security industry. However,\nthe general public uses the term hacker to refer to the same thing. In computer terminology, the\nmeaning of “hacker” can be much broader. The name comes from the opposite of “white hat\nhackers.”\nA white hat hacker is considered an ethical hacker. In the realm of IT, a “white hat hacker” is\na person who is ethically opposed to the abuse of computer systems. It is said that the term is\nderived from American western movies, where the protagonist typically wore a white cowboy\nhat and the antagonist typically wore a black one. As a simplified explanation, a “white hat”\ngenerally focuses on securing IT systems, whereas a “black hat” (the opposite) would like to\nbreak into them, so this sounds like an age-old game of a thief and a police.\nA brown hat hacker is one who thinks before acting or committing a malice or non-malice\ndeed.

The target of the crime and\n2. whether the crime occurs as a single event or as a series of events.\nCybercrime can be targeted against individuals (persons), assets (property) and/or\norganizations (government, business and social).\n1. Crimes targeted at individuals: The goal is to exploit human weakness such as greed\nand naivety. These crimes include financial frauds, sale of non-existent or stolen items,\nchild pornography (explained in Section 1.5.13, Chapter 1), copyright violation,\nharassment, etc. with the development in the IT and the Internet; thus, criminals have a\nnew tool that allows them to expand the pool of potential victims. However, this also\nmakes difficult to trace and apprehend the criminals.\n2. Crimes targeted at property: This includes stealing mobile devices such as cell phone,\nlaptops, personal digital assistant (PDAs), and removable medias (CDs and pen drives);\ntransmitting harmful programs that can disrupt functions of the systems and/or can wipe\nout data from hard disk, and can create the malfunctioning of the attached devices in the\nsystem such as modem, CD drive, etc.",

For\nexample, attacker interacts with the victim on the phone and/or via chat rooms to\nestablish relationship first and then they exploit that relationship to commit the sexual\nassault.\nBox 2.3 | Patriot Hacking\nPatriot hacking[1] also known as Digital Warfare, is a form of vigilante computer systems’\ncracking done by individuals or groups (usually citizens or supports of a country) against a real\nor perceived threat. Traditionally, Western countries, that is, developing countries, attempts to\nlaunch attacks on their perceived enemies.\nAlthough patriot hacking is declared as illegal in the US, however, it is reserved only for\ngovernment agencies [i.e., Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and National Security Agency\n(NSA)] as a legitimate form of attack and defense. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) raised\nthe concern about rise in cyber attacks like website defacements (explained in Box 1.4,\nChapter1) and denial-of-service attacks (DoS – refer to Section 4.9, Chapter 4), which adds as\nfuel into increase in international tension and gets mirrored it into the online world.\nAfter the war in Iraq in 2003, it is getting popular in the North America, Western Europe and\nIsrael.

Scanning and scrutinizing the gathered information for the validity of the information as\nwell as to identify the existing vulnerabilities.\n3. Launching an attack (gaining and maintaining the system access).\n2.2.1 Reconnaissance (reconnaissance= 9ఘa)\n The literal meaning of “Reconnaissance” is an act of finding something or somebody\n(especially to gain information about an enemy or potential enemy).\n In the world of “hacking,” reconnaissance phase begins with “Footprinting” – this is the\npreparation toward pre-attack phase, and involves accumulating data about the target’s\nenvironment and computer architecture to find ways to intrude into that environment.\n Footprinting gives an overview about system vulnerabilities and provides a judgment\nabout possible exploitation of those vulnerabilities.\n The objective of this preparatory phase is to understand the system, its networking ports\nand services, and any other aspects of its security that are needful for launching the\nattack.\n Thus, an attacker attempts to gather information in two phases: passive and active\nattacks. Let us understand these two phases.\n2.2.2 Passive Attacks\nA passive attack involves gathering information about a target without his/her (individual’s\nor company’s) knowledge. It can be as simple as watching a building to identify what time\nemployees enter the building premises. However, it is usually done using Internet searches or by\nGoogling (i.e., searching the required information with the help of search engine Google) an\nindividual or company to gain information.\n1. Google or Yahoo search: People search to locate information about employees.\n2. Surfing online community groups like Orkut/Facebook will prove useful to gain the\ninformation about an individual.\n3. Organization’s website may provide a personnel directory or information about key\nemployees, for example, contact details, E-Mail address, etc. These can be used in a\nsocial engineering attack to reach the target (see Section 2.3).\n4. Blogs, newsgroups, press releases, etc. are generally used as the mediums to gain\ninformation about the company or employees.\n5. Going through the job postings in particular job profiles for technical persons can provide\ninformation about type of technology, that is, servers or infrastructure devices a company maybe\nusing on its network.",

Port scanning: Identify open/close ports and services. Refer to Box 2.5.\n2. Network scanning: Understand IP Addresses and related information about the\ncomputer network systems.\n3. Vulnerability scanning: Understand the existing weaknesses in the system.\n2.2.5 Attack (Gaining and Maintaining the System Access)\nAfter the scanning and enumeration, the attack is launched using the following steps:\n1.

Impersonating an employee or valid user:\n “Impersonation” is perhaps the greatest technique used by social engineers to deceive\npeople.\n Social engineers “take advantage” of the fact that most people are basically helpful, so it\nseems harmless to tell someone who appears to be lost where the computer room is located,\nor to let someone into the building who “forgot” his/her badge, etc., or pretending to be an employee or\nvalid user on the system.\n2. Posing as an important user:\n The attacker pretends to be an important user – for example, a Chief Executive Officer\n(CEO) or high-level manager who needs immediate assistance to gain access to a system.\n The attacker uses intimidation so that a lower-level employee such as a help-desk worker\nwill help him/her in gaining access to the system. Most of the low-level employees will\nnot ask any question to someone who appears to be in a position of authority.\n3. Using a third person:\n An attacker pretends to have permission from an authorized source to use a system. This\ntrick is useful when the supposed authorized personnel is on vacation or cannot be\ncontacted for verification.\n4. Calling technical support:\n Calling the technical support for assistance is a classic social engineering example.\n Help-desk and technical support personnel are trained to help users, which makes them\ngood prey for social engineering attacks.\n5. Shoulder surfing:\n It is a technique of gathering information such as usernames and passwords by watching\nover a person’s shoulder while he/she logs into the system, thereby helping an attacker to\ngain access to the system.\n6. Dumpster diving:\n It involves looking in the trash for information written on pieces of paper or\ncomputer printouts.\n This is a typical North American term; it is used to describe the practice of rummaging\nthrough commercial or residential trash to find useful free items that have been discarded.\n It is also called dumpstering, binning, trashing, garbing or garbage gleaning.\n “Scavenging” is another term to describe these habits.\n In the UK, the practice is referred to as “ binning” or “skipping” and the person doing it\nis a “binner” or a “skipper.”",

Fake E-Mails:\n The attacker sends fake E-Mails (see Box 2.7) to users in such that the user finds it as a\nreal e-mail.\n This activity is also called “Phishing”.\n It is an attempt to attract the Internet users (netizens) to reveal their personal information,\nsuch as usernames, passwords and credit card details by impersonating as a\ntrustworthy and legitimate organization or an individual.\n Banks, financial institutes and payment gateways are the common targets.\n Phishing is typically carried out through E-Mails or instant messaging and often directs\nusers to enter details at a website, usually designed by the attacker with abiding the look\nand feel of the original website.\n Thus, Phishing is also an example of social engineering techniques used to fool netizens.\n The term “Phishing” has been evolved from the analogy that Internet scammers are using\nE-Mails attract to fish for passwords and financial data from the sea of Internet users (i.e.,\nnetizens).\n The term was coined in 1996 by hackers who were stealing AOL Internet accounts by\nscamming passwords without the knowledge of AOL users.\n As hackers have a tendency of replacing “f” with “ph,” the term “Phishing” came into\nbeing.\n2. E-Mail attachments:\n E-Mail attachments are used to send malicious code to a victim’s system, which will\nautomatically (e.g., keylogger utility to capture passwords) get executed.\n Viruses, Trojans, and worms can be included cleverly into the attachments to entice a\nvictim to open the attachment.\n3. Pop-up windows:\n Pop-up windows are also used, in a similar manner to E-Mail attachments. Pop-up\nwindows with special offers or free stuff can encourage a user to unintentionally install\nmalicious software.\n2.4 Cyberstalking\n The dictionary meaning of “stalking” is an “act or process of following prey stealthily –\ntrying to approach somebody or something.”\n Cyberstalking has been defined as the use of information and communications\ntechnology, particularly the Internet, by an individual or group of individuals to harass\nanother individual, group of individuals, or organization.\n The behavior includes false accusations, monitoring, transmission of threats, ID theft,",

As the\nInternet has become an integral part of our personal and professional lives, cyberstalkers take\nadvantage of ease of communication and an increased access topersonal information available with a\nfew mouse clicks or keystrokes.\n2.4.1 Types of Stalkers\nThere are primarily two types of stalkers.\n1. Online stalkers:\n They aim to start the interaction with the victim directly with the help of the Internet.\n E-Mail and chat rooms are the most popular communication medium to get connected\nwith the victim, rather than using traditional instrumentation like telephone/cell\nphone.\n The stalker makes sure that the victim recognizes the attack attempted on him/her.\n The stalker can make use of a third party to harass the victim.\n2. Offline stalkers:\n The stalker may begin the attack using traditional methods such as following the\nvictim, watching the daily routine of the victim, etc.\n Searching on message boards/newsgroups, personal websites, and people finding\nservices or websites are most common ways to gather information about the victim\nusing the Internet.\n The victim is not aware that the Internet has been used to perpetuate an attack against\nthem.\n2.4.2 Cases Reported on Cyberstalking\n The majority of cyberstalkers are men and the majority of their victims are women.\n Some cases also have been reported where women act as cyberstalkers and men as the\nvictims as well as cases of same-sex cyberstalking.\n In many cases, the cyberstalker and the victim hold a prior relationship, and the\ncyberstalking begins when the victim attempts to break off the relationship, for example,\nex-lover, ex-spouse, boss/subordinate, and neighbor.\n However, there also have been many instances of cyberstalking by strangers.\n2.4.3 How Stalking Works?\nIt is seen that stalking works in the following ways:\n1.

The\nletters may have the tone of loving, threatening or can be sexually explicit. The stalker\nmay use multiple names while contacting the victim.\n4. Some stalkers keep on sending repeated E-Mails asking for various kinds of favors or\nthreaten the victim.\n5. The stalker may post the victim’s personal information on any website related to illicit\nservices such as sex-workers’ services or dating services, posing as if the victim has\nposted the information and invite the people to call the victim on the given contact details\n(telephone numbers/cell phone numbers/E-Mail address) to have sexual services. The\nstalker will use bad and/or offensive/attractive language to invite the interested persons.\n6. Whosoever comes across the information, start calling the victim on the given contact\ndetails ( telephone/cell phone nos), asking for sexual services or relationships.\n7. Some stalkers subscribe/register the E-Mail account of the victim to innumerable\npornographic and sex sites, because of which victim will start receiving such kind of\nunsolicited E-Mails.\n2.4.4 Real-Life Incident of Cyberstalking\nCase Study\nThe Indian police have registered first case of cyberstalking in Delhi – the brief account of the\ncase has been mentioned here. To maintain confidentiality and privacy of the entities involved,\nwe have changed their names.\n Mrs. Joshi received almost 40 calls in 3 days mostly at odd hours from as far away as\nKuwait, Cochin, Bombay, and Ahmadabad.\n The said calls created havoc in the personal life destroying mental peace of Mrs. Joshi\nwho decided to register a complaint with Delhi Police.\n A person was using her ID to chat over the Internet at the website www.mirc.com, mostly\nin the Delhi channel for four consecutive days.\n This person was chatting on the Internet, using her name and giving her address, talking\nin obscene language.\n The same person was also deliberately giving her telephone number to other chatters\nencouraging them to call Mrs. Joshi at odd hours.\n This was the first time when a case of cyberstalking was registered.\n Cyberstalking does not have a standard definition but it can be defined to mean\nthreatening, unwarranted behavior, or advances directed by one person toward another\nperson using Internet and other forms of online communication channels as medium.\nBox 2.8 | Cyberbullying\nThe National Crime Prevention Council defi nes Cyberbullying as “when the Internet,\ncell phones or other devices are used to send or post text or images intended to hurt or embarrass",

Deep Freeze can wipe out the\ndetails of all activities carried out on the computer when one clicks on the\n“restart” button. Such practices present challenges to the police or crime\ninvestigators when they visit the cybercafes to pick up clues after the Interet\nService Provider (ISP) points to a particular IP address from where a threat mail\nwas probably sent or an online Phishing attack was carried out, to retrieve logged\nfiles.\n4. Annual maintenance contract (AMC) found to be not in a place for servicing the\ncomputers; hence, hard disks for all the computers are not formatted unless the\ncomputer is down. Not having the AMC is a risk from cybercrime perspective\nbecause a cybercriminal can install a Malicious Code on a computer and conduct\ncriminal activities without any interruption.\n5. Pornographic websites and other similar websites with indecent contents are not\nblocked.\n6. Cybercafe owners have very less awareness about IT Security and IT Governance.\n7. Government/ISPs/State Police (cyber cell wing) do not seem to provide IT\nGovernance guidelines to cybercafe owners.\n8. Cybercafe association or State Police (cyber cell wing) do not seem to conduct\nperiodic visits to cybercafes – one of the cybercafe owners whom we interviewed\nexpressed a view that the police will not visit a cybercafe unless criminal activity\nis registered by filing an First Information Report (FIR). Cybercafe owners feel\nthat police either have a very little knowledge about the technical aspects involved\nin cybercrimes and/or about conceptual understanding of IT security. There are\nthousands of cybercafes across India.\nIn the event that a central agency takes up the responsibility for monitoring cybercafes,\nan individual should take care while visiting and/or operating from cybercafe. Here are a few tips\nfor safety and security while using the computer in a cybercafe:\n1. Always logout:\n2. Stay with the computer:\n3. Clear history and temporary files:\n4. Be alert:\n5. Avoid online financial transactions:\n6. Change passwords:\n7. Use Virtual keyboard:\n8. Security warnings:",

Figure 2.8 explains how Botnets create\nbusiness.\n One can reduce the chances of becoming part of a Bot by limiting access into the system.\n Leaving your Internet connection ON and unprotected is just like leaving the front door\nof the house wide open.\nOne can ensure following to secure the system:\n1. Use antivirus and anti-Spyware software and keep it up-to-date:\n2. Set the OS to download and install security patches automatically:\n3. Use a firewall to protect the system from hacking attacks while it is connected on the\nInternet: A firewall is a software and/or hardware that is designed to block unauthorized\naccess while permitting authorized communications.\n4. Disconnect from the Internet when you are away from your computer:\n5. Downloading the freeware only from websites that are known and trustworthy:\n6. Check regularly the folders in the mail box – “sent items” or “outgoing” – for those",

All of these methods involve programming (or, in a\nfew cases, hardware), except deception, in which a human operator is fooled into\nremoving or weakening system defenses.\n To some extent, firewalls and antivirus software can block attack vectors.\n However, no protection method is totally attack-proof.\n A defense method that is effective today may not remain so for long because attackers are\nconstantly updating attack vectors, and seeking new ones, in their quest to gain\nunauthorized access to computers and servers. Refer to Box 2.10.\n The most common malicious payloads are viruses (which can function as their own\nattack vectors), Trojan Horses, worms, and Spyware.\n If an attack vector is thought of as a guided missile, its payload can be compared to the\nwarhead in the tip of the missile.\n In the technical terms, payload is the necessary data being carried within a packet or other\ntransmission unit – in this scenario (i.e., attack vector) payload means the malicious\nactivity that the attack performs.\n From the technical perspective, payload does not include the “overhead” data required to\nget the packet to its destination.

The attack vectors described here are how most of them are\nlaunched.\n1. Attack by E-Mail: The content is either embedded in the message or linked to by the\nmessage. Sometimes attacks combine the two vectors, so that if the message does not get\nyou, the attachment will. Spam is almost always carrier for scams, fraud, dirty tricks, or\nmalicious action of some kind. Any link that offers something “free” or tempting is a\nsuspect.\n2. Attachments (and other files): Malicious attachments install malicious computer code.\nThe code could be a virus, Trojan Horse, Spyware, or any other kind of malware.\nAttachments attempt to install their payload as soon as you open them.\n3. Attack by deception: Deception is aimed at the user/operator as a vulnerable entry point.\nIt is not just malicious computer code that one needs to monitor. Fraud, scams, and to\nsome extent Spam, not to mention viruses, worms and such require the unwitting\ncooperation of the computer’s operator to succeed. Social engineering are other forms of\ndeception that are often an attack vector too.\n4. Hackers: Hackers/crackers are a formidable attack vector because, unlike ordinary\nMalicious Code, people are flexible and they can improvise. Hackers/crackers use variety\nof hacking tools, heuristics, Cyberoffenses: How and social engineering to gain access to\ncomputers and online accounts. They often install a Trojan Horse to commandeer the\ncomputer for their own use.\n5. Heedless guests (attack by webpage): Counterfeit websites are used to extract personal\ninformation. Such websites look very much like the genuine websites they imitate. One\nmay think he/she is doing business with someone you trust. However, he/she is really\ngiving their personal information, like address, credit card number, and expiration date.\nThey are often used in conjunction with Spam, which gets you there in the first place. Pop-\nup webpages may install Spyware, Adware or Trojans.\n6. Attack of the worms: Many worms are delivered as E-Mail attachments, but network\nworms use holes in network protocols directly. Any remote access service, like file sharing, is likely\nto be vulnerable to this sort of worm. In most cases, a firewall will block system worms. Many of these\nsystem worms install Trojan Horses.\n7. Malicious macros: Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel are some of the examples that\nallow macros. A macro does something like automating a spreadsheet, for example.\nMacros can also be used for malicious purposes. All Internet services like instant\nmessaging, Internet Relay Chart(IRC), and P2P fi le-sharing networks rely on cozy\nconnections between the computer and the other computers on the Internet. If one is\nusing P2P software then his/her system is more vulnerable to hostile exploits.\n8.

The service is fully managed by the provider – a user just needs PC and Internet\nconnection.\nSignificant innovations into distributed computing and virtualization as well as improved\naccess speed over the Internet have generated a great demand for cloud computing.\n2.8.1 Why Cloud Computing?\nThe cloud computing has following advantages.\n1. Applications and data can be accessed from anywhere at any time. Data may not be held\non a hard drive on one user’s computer.\n2. It could bring hardware costs down. One would need the Internet connection.\n3. Organizations do not have to buy a set of software or software licenses for every\nemployee and the organizations could pay a metered fee to a cloud computing company.\n4. Organizations do not have to rent a physical space to store servers and databases. Servers\nand digital storage devices take up space. Cloud computing gives the option of storing\ndata on someone else’s hardware, thereby removing the need for physical space on the\nfront end.\n5. Organizations would be able to save money on IT support because organizations will\nhave to ensure about the desktop (i.e., a client) and continuous Internet connectivity\ninstead of servers and other hardware. The cloud computing services can be either private\nor public.\n2.8.2 Types of Services\nServices provided by cloud computing are as follows:\n1. Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS): It is like Amazon Web Services that provide virtual\nservers with unique IP addresses and blocks of storage on demand. Customers benefit from an\nApplication Programmable Interface (API) from which they can control their servers. As\ncustomers can pay for exactly the amount of service they use, like for electricity or water, this service is\nalso called utility computing.\n2. Platform-as-a-service (PaaS): It is a set of software and development tools hosted on\nthe provider’s servers. Developers can create applications using the provider’s APIs.\nGoogle Apps is one of the most famous PaaS providers. Developers should take notice\nthat there are not any interoperability standards; therefore, some providers may not allow\nyou to take your application and put it on another platform.\n3. Software-as-a-service (SaaS): It is the broadest market. In this case, the provider allows\nthe customer only to use its applications. The software interacts with the user through\na user interface. These applications can be anything from Web-based E-Mail to\napplications such as Twitter or Last.fm.\n2.8.3 Cybercrime and Cloud Computing\n Nowadays, prime area of the risk in cloud computing is protection of user data. Although\ncloud computing is an emerging field, the idea has been evolved over few years.\n Risks associated with cloud computing environment are as follows",

      "text": "Module 3\nTools and Methods Used in Cybercrime\nIntroduction\nDifferent forms of attacks through which attackers target the computer systems are as\nfollows:\n1. Initial uncovering:\n Two steps are involved here.\ni. In the first step called as reconnaissance, the attacker gathers information\nabout the target on the Internet websites.\nii. In the second step, the attacker finds the company’s internal network,\nsuch as, Internet domain, machine names and the company’s Internet\nProtocol (IP) address ranges to steal the data.\n2. Network probe (investigation):\n At the network probe stage, the attacker scans the organization information through\na “ping sweep” of the network IP addresses.\n Then a “port scanning” tool is used to discover exactly which services are running\non the target system.\n At this point, the attacker has still not done anything that would be considered\nas an abnormal activity on the network or anything that can be classified as an\nintrusion.\n3. Crossing the line toward electronic crime (E-crime):\n Once the attackers are able to access a user account, then they will attempt further\nexploits to get an administrator or “root” access.\n Root access is a UNIX term and is associated with the system privileges required\nto run all services and access all files on the system (readers are expected to have a\nbasic familiarity with Unix-based systems).\n “Root” is an administrator or super-user access and grants them the privileges to do\nanything on the system.\n4. Capturing the network:\n At this stage, the attacker attempts to “own” the network. The attacker gains the\ninternal network quickly and easily by target systems.\nJyothi R, A ssistant Professor, Dept.of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) Page 1",

The attacker will usually\ninstall a set of tools that replace existing files and services with Trojan files\nand services that have a backdoor password.\n5. Grab the data:\n Now that the attacker has “captured the network,” he/she takes advantage of his/her\nposition to steal confidential data\n6. Covering tracks:\n This is the last step in any cyber attack, which refers to the activities undertaken\nby the attacker to extend misuse of the system without being detected.\n The attacker can remain undetected for long periods.\n During this entire process, the attacker takes optimum care to hide his/her identity\n(ID) from the first step itself.\nProxy Servers and Anonymizers\nProxy server is a computer on a network which acts as an intermediary for connection with\nother computers on that network.\n The attacker first connects to a proxy server and establishes a connection with the\ntarget system through existing connection with proxy.\n This enables an attacker to surf on the Web anonymously and/or hide the attack.\n A client connects to the proxy server and requests some services (such as a file, webpage)\navailable from a different server.\n The proxy server evaluates the request and provides the resource by establishing\nthe connection to the respective server and/or requests the required service on\nbehalf of the client.\n Using a proxy server can allow an attacker to hide ID (i.e., become anonymous\non the network).\nA proxy server has following purposes:\n1. Keep the systems behind the curtain (mainly for security reasons).\n2. Speed up access to a resource (through “caching”). It is usually used to cache the web\npages from a web server.\n3. Specialized proxy servers are used to filter unwanted content such as advertisements.\n4.

It accesses the Internet on the user’s behalf, protecting\npersonal information by hiding the source computer’s identifying information.\n Anonymizers are services used to make Web surfing anonymous by utilizing a\nwebsite that acts as a proxy server for the web client.\nPhishing\n“Phishing” refers to an attack using mail programs to deceive Internet users into disclosing\nconfidential information that can be then exploited for illegal purposes.\n While checking electronic mail (E-Mail) one day a user finds a message from the bank\nthreatening to close the bank account if he/she does not reply immediately.\n Although the message seems to be suspicious from the contents of the message, it is\ndifficult to conclude that it is a fake/false E-Mail.\n This message and other such messages are examples of Phishing – in addition to stealing\npersonal and financial data – and can infect systems with viruses and also a method of\nonline ID theft in various cases.\n These messages look authentic and attempt to get users to reveal their personal information.\n It is believed that Phishing is an alternative spelling of “fishing,” as in “to fish for\ninformation.”\n The first documented use of the word “Phishing” was in 1996.\nHow Phishing Works?\nPhishers work in the following ways:\n1. Planning: Criminals, usually called as phishers, decide the target.\n2. Setup: Once phishers know which business/business house to spoof and who their\nvictims.\n3. Attack: the phisher sends a phony message that appears to be from a reputable source.\n4.

Identity theft and fraud: Phishers use the information that they have gathered to make\nillegal purchases or commit fraud.\nNowadays, more and more organizations/institutes provide greater online access for their\ncustomers and hence criminals are successfully using Phishing techniques to steal personal\ninformation and conduct ID theft at a global level.\nPassword Cracking\n Password is like a key to get an entry into computerized systems like a lock.\n Password cracking is a process of recovering passwords from data that have been stored\nin or transmitted by a computer system.\n Usually, an attacker follows a common approach – repeatedly making guesses for\nthe password.\nThe purpose of password cracking is as follows:\n1. To recover a forgotten password.\n2. As a preventive measure by system administrators to check for easily crackable\npasswords.\n3. To gain unauthorized access to a system.\nManual password cracking is to attempt to logon with different passwords. The attacker\nfollows the following steps:\n1. Find a valid user account such as an Administrator or Guest;\n2. create a list of possible passwords;\n3. rank the passwords from high to low probability;\n4. key-in each password;\n5. try again until a successful password is found.\nPasswords can be guessed sometimes with knowledge of the user’s personal\ninformation. Examples of guessable passwords include:\n1. Blank (none);\n2. the words like “password,” “passcode” and “admin”;\n3. series of letters from the “QWERTY” keyboard, for example, qwerty, asdf or\nqwertyuiop;\n4. user’s name or login name;\nJyothi R, A ssistant Professor, Dept.of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) Page 4",

If they match,\nuser gains the access; this process is called authentication.\nThe most commonly used hash functions can be computed rapidly and the attacker can test\nthese hashes with the help of passwords cracking tools (see Table 4.3) to get the plain text\npassword.\nPassword cracking attacks can be classified under three categories as follows:\n1. Online attacks;\n2. offline attacks;\n3. non-electronic attacks (e.g., social engineering, shoulder surfing and dumpster diving).\nOnline Attacks\n An attacker can create a script file that will be executed to try each password in a list and\nwhen matches, an attacker can gain the access to the system.\n The most popular online attack is man-in-the middle (MITM) attack, also termed as\n“bucket- brigade attack” or sometimes “Janus attack.”\n It is a form of active stealing in which the attacker establishes a connection between a\nJyothi R, A ssistant Professor, Dept.of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) Page 5",

Passwords used for business E-Mail accounts, personal E-Mail accounts and\nbanking/financial user accounts should be kept separate.\n2. Passwords should be of minimum eight alphanumeric characters (common names or\nphrases should be phrased).\n3. Passwords should be changed every 30/45 days.\n4. Passwords should not be shared with relatives and/or friends.\n5. Password used previously should not be used while renewing the password.\n6. Passwords of personal E-Mail accounts and banking/financial user accounts should be\nchanged from a secured system, within couple of days, if these E-Mail accounts\nhas been accessed from public Internet facilities such as cybercafes/hotels/libraries.\n7.

Boot sector viruses: It infects the storage media on which OS is stored (e.g., hard drives)\nand which is used to start the computer system.\n2. Program viruses: These viruses become active when the program file (usually with\nextensions .bin, .com,.exe, .ovl, .drv) is excuted\n3. Multipartite viruses: It is a hybrid of a boot sector and program viruses. It infects program\nfiles along with the boot record when the infected program is active.\n4. Stealth viruses: It hides itself and so detecting this type of virus is very difficult. It can\nhiding itself such a way that antivirus software also cannot detect it. Example for Stealth\nvirus is “Brain Virus”.\n5. Polymorphic viruses: It acts like a “chameleon” that changes its virus signature (i.e.,\nbinary pattern) every time it spreads through the system (i.e., multiplies and infects a new\nfile). Hence, it is always difficult to detect polymorphic virus with the help of an antivirus\nprogram.\n6. Macro viruses: Many applications, such as Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel, support\nMACROs (i.e., macrolanguages). These macros are programmed as a macro embedded in\na document. Once macrovirus gets onto a victim’s computer then every document he/she\nproduces will become infected.\n7.

They erase, overwrite or corrupt data on a computer.\n2. They help to spread other malware such as viruses (by a dropper Trojan).\n3. They deactivate or interfere with antivirus and firewall programs.\n4. They allow remote access to your computer (by a remote access Trojan).\n5.

Unusually slow network performance (opening fi les or accessing websites);\n2. unavailability of a particular website;\n3. inability to access any website;\n4. dramatic increase in the number of Spam E-Mails received (this type of DoS\nattack is termed as an E-Mail bomb).\nThe goal of DoS is not to gain unauthorized access to systems or data, but to prevent\nintended users (i.e., legitimate users) of a service from using it.\nA DoS attack may do the following:\n1. Flood a network with traffic, thereby preventing legitimate network traffic.\n2. Disrupt connections between two systems, thereby preventing access to a service.\n3.

Unintentional DoS attack : This is a scenario where a website ends up denied not due to\na attack by a single individual or group of individuals, but simply due to a sudden enormous\nspike in popularity.\nTypes or Levels of DoS Attacks\nThere are several types or levels of DoS attacks as follows:\n1. Flood attack: This is the earliest form of DoS attack and is also known as ping food. It is\nbased on an attacker simply sending the victim overwhelming number of ping packets,\nusually by using the “ping” command, which result into more traffic than the victim can\nhandle.\n2. Ping of death attack: The ping of death attack sends oversized Internet Control\nMessage Protocol (ICMP) packets, and it is one of the core protocols of the IP Suite. It\nis mainly used by networked computers’ OSs to send error messages indicating (e.g., that\na requested service is not available or that a host or router could not be reached) datagrams\n(encapsulated in IP packets) to the victim.\n3. SYN attack: It is also termed as TCP SYN Flooding. In the TCP, handshaking of network\nconnections is done with SYN and ACK messages.\n An attacker initiates a TCP connection to the server with an SYN.\n The server replies with an SYN-ACK.\n The client then does not send back an ACK, causing the server to allocate memory for\nthe pending connection and wait.\n This fills up the buffer space for SYN messages on the target system, preventing other\nsystems on the network from communicating with the target system.\n4. Teardrop attack: The teardrop attack is an attack where fragmented packets are forged\nto overlap each other when the receiving host tries to reassemble them. IP’s packet\nfragmentation algorithm is used to send corrupted packets to confuse the victim\nJyothi R, A ssistant Professor, Dept.of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) Page 18",

Nuke: Nuke is an old DoS attack against computer networks consisting of fragmented or\ninvalid packets sent to the target.\nTools Used to Launch DoS Attack\n1. Jolt2 : The vulnerability allows remote attackers to cause a DoS attack against Windows-\nbased machines – the attack causes the target machine to consume of the CPU time on\nprocessing of illegal packets.\n2. Nemesy : This program generates random packets of spoofed source IP to enable the\nattacker to launch DoS attack.\n3. Targa : It is a program that can be used to run eight different DoS attacks. The attacker\nhas the option to launch either individual attacks or try all the attacks until one is successful.\n4. Crazy Pinger : This tool could send large packets of ICMP(Internet Control Message\nProtocol) to a remote target network.\n5. SomeTrouble: It is a remote flooder and bomber. It is developed in Delphi.\nDDoS Attacks\n In a DDoS attack, an attacker may use your computer to attack another computer.\n By taking advantage of security vulnerabilities or weaknesses, an attacker could take\ncontrol of your computer.\n He/she could then force your computer to send huge amounts of data to a website or send\nSpam to particular E-Mail addresses.\n The attack is “distributed” because the attacker is using multiple computers, including\nyours, to launch the DoS attack.\n A DDoS attack is a distributed DoS wherein a large number of zombie systems are\nsynchronized to attack a particular system.\nJyothi R, A ssistant Professor, Dept.of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) Page 19",

Access points: It is also termed as AP. It is a hardware device and/or software that act as\na central transmitter and receiver of WLAN radio signals. Users of wireless device, such\nas laptop/PDAs, get connected with these APs, which in turn get connected with the wired\nLAN. An AP acts as a communication hub for users to connect with the wired LAN.\n3. Wi-Fi hotspots: A hotspot is a site that offers the Internet access by using Wi-Fi\ntechnology over a WLAN. Hotspots are found in public areas (such as coffee shops, public\nlibraries, hotels and restaurants) and are commonly offered facility throughout much of\nNorth America and Europe.\n Free Wi-Fi hotspots: Wireless Internet service is offered in public areas, free of cost\nand that to without any authentication.\n Commercial hotspots: The users are redirected to authentication and online payment to\navail the wireless Internet service in public areas.\n4. Service Set IDentifier (SSID): It is the name of 802.11i WLAN and all wireless devices\non a WLAN must use the same SSID to communicate with each other. While setting up\nWLAN, the user (or WLAN administrator) sets the SSID, which can be up to 32 characters\nlong so that only the users who knew the SSID will be able to connect the WLAN. It is\nalways advised to turn OFF the broadcast of the SSID.\n5. Wired equivalence privacy (WEP): Wireless transmission is susceptible to\neavesdropping and to provide confidentiality, WEP was introduced as part of the original\n802.11i Protocol in 1997. It is always termed as deprecated security algorithm for IEEE\n802.11i WLANs. SSID along with WEP delivers fair amount of secured wireless network.\n6. Wi-Fi protected access (WPA and WPA2): WPA was introduced as an interim standard\nto replace WEP to improve upon the security features of WEP. WPA2 provides a stronger\nencryption mechanism through Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), which is a\nrequirement for some corporate and government agencies.\n7. Media access control (MAC): It is a unique identifier of each node (i.e., each network\ninterfaces) of the network and it is assigned by the manufacturer of a network interface\ncard (NIC) stored in its hardware. MAC address filtering allows only the devices with\nspecific MAC addresses to access the network.\nJyothi R, A ssistant Professor, Dept.of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) Page 22",

There are various methods that demand high level of technological\nskill and knowledge, and availability of numerous software tools made it less sophisticated with\nminimal technological skill to crack WLANs.\n1. Sniffing: The attacker usually installs the sniffers remotely on the victim’s system and\nconducts activities such as\n Passive scanning of wireless network;\n detection of SSID;\n colleting the MAC address;\n collecting the frames to crack WEP.\n2. Spoofing: The attacker often launches an attack on a wireless network by simply creating\na new network with a stronger wireless signal and a copied SSID in the same area as a\noriginal network. Different types of Spoofing are as follows.\n MAC address Spoofing\n IP Spoofing:\n Frame Spoofing:\n3. Denial of service (DoS): We have explained this attack in detail in UNIT-2.\n4. Man-in-the-middle attack (MITM): It refers to the scenario wherein an attacker on host\nA inserts A between all communications – between hosts X and Y without knowledge of X\nand Y. All messages sent by X do reach Y but through A and vice versa. The objective\nbehind this attack is to merely observe the communication or modify it before sending it\nout.\n5.

The attackers always devise new tools and techniques to\ndeconstruct the older encryption technology, which is quite easy for attackers due to\ncontinuous research in this field. Hence, the second step is to use a long and highly\nrandomized encryption key; this is very important. It is a little pain to remember long\nrandom encryption; however, at the same time these keys are much harder to crack.\nHow to Secure the Wireless Networks\nNowadays, security features of Wi-Fi networking products are not that time-consuming\nand nonintuitive; however, they are still ignored, especially, by home users. Although following\nsummarized steps will help to improve and strengthen the security of wireless network, to know\nthe available tools to monitor and protect the wireless networks:\n1. Change the default settings of all the equipments/components of wireless network (e.g., IP\naddress/ user IDs/administrator passwords, etc.).\n2. Enable WPA/WEP encryption.\n3. Change the default SSID.\n4. Enable MAC address filtering.\n5. Disable remote login.\n6. Disable SSID broadcast.\n7. Disable the features that are not used in the AP (e.g., printing/music support).\n8. Avoid providing the network a name which can be easily identified (e.g.,\nMy_Home_Wifi ).\n9. Connect only to secured wireless network (i.e., do not autoconnect to open Wi-Fi\nhotspots).\n10. Upgrade router’s firmware periodically.\n11. Assign static IP addresses to devices.\n12. Enable firewalls on each computer and the router.\n13. Position the router or AP safely.\n14. Turn off the network during extended periods when not in use.\n15. Periodic and regular monitor wireless network security.\nJyothi R, A ssistant Professor, Dept.of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) Page 25",

Spam E-Mails\n Also known as “junk E-Mails” they involve nearly identical messages sent to\nnumerous recipients. Spam E-Mails have steadily grown since the early 1990s.\nBotnets, networks of virus-infected computers, are used to send about 80% of\nSpam.\n Types of Spam E-Mails are as follows:\n2. Unsolicited bulk E-Mail (UBE): It is synonym for SPAM unsolicited E-Mail sent in large\nquantities.\n3. Unsolicited commercial E-Mail (UCE): Unsolicited E-Mails are sent in large quantities\nfrom commercial perspective, for example, advertising. See Box 5.3 to know more about\nUS Act on Spam mails.\nExamples:\n1. HSBC, Santander, CommonWealth Bank: International Banks having large customer\nbase, phishers always dive deep in such ocean to attempt to hook the fish.\n2. eBay: It is a popular auction site, often mimicked to gain personal information.\n3. Amazon: It was the top brand to be exploited by phishers till July 2009.\n4. Facebook: Netizens, who liked to be on the most popular social networking sites such as\nFacebook, are always subject to threats within Facebook as well as through E-Mail. One\ncan reduce chances of being victim of Phising attack by using the services – security\nsettings to enable contact and E-Mail details as private.\nThe E-Mail will usually ask the user to provide valuable information about himself\n/herself or to “verify” information that the user may have provided in the past while\nJyothi R, A ssistant Professor, Dept.of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) Page 26",

Names of legitimate organizations: Instead of creating a phony company from\nscratch, the phisher might use a legitimate company’s name and incorporate the\nlook and feel of its website (i.e., including the color scheme and graphics) into the\nSpam E-Mail.\n2. “From” a real employee: Real name of an official, who actually works for the\norganization. This way, if a user contacts the organization to confirm whether\n“Rajeev Arora” truly is “Vice President of Marketing” then the user gets a positive\nresponse and feels assured.\n3. URLs that “look right”: The E-Mail might contain a URL (i.e., weblink) which\nseems to be original website wherein user can enter the information the phisher\nwould like to steal.\n4. Urgent messages: Creating a fear to trigger a response is very common in Phishing\nattacks – the E-Mails warn that failure to respond will result in no longer having\naccess to the account or E-Mails might claim that organization has detected\nsuspicious activity in the users’ account or that organization is implementing new\nprivacy software for ID theft solutions.\nHere are a few examples of phrases used to entice the user to take the action.\n1. “Verify your account”:\n2. “You have won the lottery”:\n3. “If you don’t respond within 48 hours, your account will be closed”:\nLet us understand the ways to reduce the amount of Spam E-Mails we receive.\n1. Share personal E-Mail address with limited people and/or on public websites – the more it\nis exposed to the public, the more Spam E-Mails will be received.\n2. Never reply or open any Spam E-Mails.\n3. Disguise the E-Mail address on public website or groups by spelling out the sign “@” and\nthe DOT (.); for example, RajeevATgmailDOTcom.

URLs that look right:\n• The E-Mail might contain a URL (i.e., weblink) which seems to be legitimate website\nwherein user can enter the information the phisher would like to steal.\n• However, in reality the website will be a quickly cobbled copycat -a spoofed\" website\nthat looks like the real thing, that is, legitimate website. In some cases, the link might\nlead to selected pages of a legitimate website- such as the real company's actual\nprivacy policy or legal disclaimer.\n• 4. Urgent messages:\n• Creating a fear to trigger a response is very common in Phishing attacks – the E-\nMails warn that failure to respond will result in no longer having access to the\naccount or E-Mails might claim that organization has detected suspicious activity in\nthe users' account or that organization is implementing new privacy software for ID theft\nsolutions.\nHere are a few examples of phrases used to entice the user to take the action.\n• 1. Verity your account:\n• The organization will never ask the user to send passwords, login names, permanent\naccount numbers (PANs) or SSNs and other personal information through E-Mail.\n• For example, if you receive an E-Mail message from Microsoft asking you to update your\ncredit card Information, do not respond without any confirmation with Microsoft\nauthorities- this is a perfect example of Phishing attack.\n• 2. You have won the lottery:\n• The lottery scam is a common Phishing scam known as advanced fee fraud. One of\nthe most common forms of advanced fee fraud is a message that claims that you have\nwon a large sum of money, or that a person will pay you a large sum of money for\nlittle or no work your part.\n• The lottery scam often includes references to big companies, for example, Microsoft.\n• There is no Microsoft lottery. It is observed that most of the phished E-Mails display\nthe agencies/companies situated in Great Britain and hence it is extremely important\nfor netizens to confirm/verify the authenticity of such E-Mails before sending any\nresponse.\nIf \" any-Mail is received displaying \"You have won the lottery in Great Britain,\"\nconfirm it on www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk\n• If any E-Mail is received displaying your selection for any job into Great Britain,\nconfirm/verify the details of the organization on www.companieshouse.gov.uk\nor on http://www.upmystreet. com/local/uk.html\n• 3. If you don’t respond within 48 hours, your account will be closed\n• These messages convey a sense of urgency so that you will respond immediately\nwithout thinking. A Phishing E-Mail message might even claim that your response\nis required because your account might have been compromised\nLet us understand the ways to reduce the amount of Spam E-Mails we receive\n• 1. Share personal Email address with limited people and/or on public websites-the more\nexposed to the public, the more Spam E-Mails will be received.\n• 2. Never reply or open any Spam E-Mails. Any spam E-Mails that are opened or\nreplied to inform the phishers not only about your existence but also about validity\nof your E-Mail address.\n• 3. Disguise the E-Mail address on public website or groups by spelling out the sign\n\"@” and the DOT for example, RajeevATgmailDOTcom.

      "text": "2. Road-and-reel\n• In this method, phishers identify specific prospective victims in advance, and\nconvey false information to them to prompt their disclosure of personal and\nfinancial data.\n• For example, on the phony webpage, availability of similar item for a better price\n(i.e., cheaper price) is displayed which the victims may be searching for and upon\nvisiting the webpage, victims were asked for personal information such as name,\nbank account numbers and passwords, before confirming that the \"sale\" and the\ninformation is available to the phisher easily.\n• 3. Lobsterpot\n• This method focuses upon use of spoofed websites.\n• It consists of creating of bogus/ phony websites, similar to legitimate corporate\nones, targeting a narrowly defined class of victims, which is likely to seek out.\n• These attacks are also known as \"content injection Phishing.”\n• Here the phisher places a weblink into an E-Mail message to make it look more\nlegitimate and actually takes the victim to a phony scam site, which appears as\nlegitimate website similar to official site. These fake sites are spoofed websites.\n• Ones the netizens is into the one of these spoofed sites, he/she might willingly send\npersonal information to the con artist. Then they use your information to purchase\ngoods, apply new credit card or to steal your identity.\n4. Gillnet\n This technique relies far less on social engineering techniques and phishers\nintroduce Malicious Code into E-Mails and websites.\n They can, for example, misuse browser functionality by injecting hostile content\ninto another site's pop-up window.\n Merely by opening a particular E-Mail or browsing a particular website, netizens\nmay have a Trojan Horse introduced into their systems.\n In some cases, the Malicious Code will change settings in user's systems so that\nusers who want to visit legitimate banking websites will be redirected to a look-alike\nPhishing site.\nJ yothi R, Assistant Professor, Dept.of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) 7",

Phishing may, at times, require Spoofing to entice the victim into revealing the\ninformation about Spoofing does not always necessarily result in Phishing\nsomeone else's account\nThe Combined Attack - Phishing and Spoofing\n• Phisher sends an E-Mail, during Income Tax return fling period, from an official\nlooking IT (Income Tax) account which is spoofed.\n• The E-Mail would contain URL to download a new tax form that was recently\nissued.\n• Once the victim clicks the URL a \"virus cum Trojan Horse\" is downloaded to the\nvictim's system.\n• The IT Form may seem official, but like a Trojan Horse, the payload has already\nbeen delivered.\n• The virus lies in wait, logging the actions of the victim.\n• Once the victim inputs certain keywords, like bank names, credit card names,\nsocial networking websites and so forth, it logs the site and the passwords used.\n• Those results are flagged and sent to the phisher.\n• The virus could then gather the user's E-Mail contacts and send a fake E-Mail to\nthem as well, containing the virus.\n• The phisher now has gained the required personal information as well as virus\nwas sent, downloaded and spread to entice other netizens.\n4.2.2.

      "text": "1. URL (weblink) manipulation\n• URLs are the weblinks (i.e., Internet addresses) that direct the netizens/users to a\nspecific website.\n• In Phishing attack, these URLs are usually supplied as misspelled, for example,\ninstead of www.abcbank.com, URL is provided as www.abcbank1.com.\n• Phishers use Lobsterpot method of Phishing and make the difference of one or two\nletters in the URLs, which is ignored by netizens.\n• This makes a big difference and it directs users to a fake/bogus website or a\nwebpage.\nHomograph Attack\n• It is used by Phisher to attack on Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) to deceive the\nnetizens by redirecting them on the phony website which look like the original\nwebsite.\n• ASCII has several characters and/or pairs of characters which look alike,\n• Eg. 0 and “O”. “l” (L lower case) and I(“i” alphabet in uppercase ) [GOOGLE.COM\ncan be registered as G00GLE.COM]\n• Microsoft.com or/rnicrosoft.com\n• Phisher could create and register a domain name which appears almost identical to\nan existing domain and takes netizens to the Phony websites.\n• Phisher could easily record password or account details though spoofed websites,\nwhile passing traffic through the original websites.\n2. Filter Evasion\n• This technique use graphics (i.e., images) instead of text to obviate from netting\nsuch E-Mails by anti-Phishing filters. Normally, these filters are inbuilt into the web\nbrowsers. For example,\n• Internet Explorer version 7 has inbuilt \"Microsoft phishing filter.\" One can enable it\nduring the installation or it can be enabled post-installation. It is important to note\nthat it is not enabled by default.\n• Firefox 2.0 and above has inbuilt \"Google Phishing filter.\" duly licensed from\nGoogle. It is enabled by default.\n• The Opera Phishing filter is dubbed Opera Fraud Protection and is included in\nversion 9.5+.\n3. Website forgery\n• In this technique the phisher directs the netizens to the website designed and\ndeveloped by him, to login into the website, by altering the browser address bar\nthrough JavaScript commands.\n• As the netizen logs into the fake/bogus website, phisher gets the confidential\ninformation very easily.\n• Another technique used is known as \"cloaked\" URL-domain forwarding and/or\ninserting control characters into the URL while concealing the weblink address of\nthe real website.\nJy othi R, Assistant Professor, Dept.of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) 10",

Flash Phishing\n• Anti-Phishing toolbars are installed/enabled to help checking the webpage content\nfor signs of Phishing, but have limitations that they do not analyse flash objects at\nall.\n• Phishers use it to emulate the legitimate website.\n• Netizens believe that the website is \"clean\" and is a real website because anti-\nPhishing toolbar is unable to detect it.\n5. Social Phishing\n• Phishers entice the netizens to reveal sensitive data by other means and it works in\na systematic manner.\n• Phisher sends a mail as if it is sent by a bank asking to call them back because\nthere was a security breach.\n• The victim calls the bank on the phone numbers displayed in the mail.\n• The phone number provided in the mail is a false number and the victim gets\nredirected to the phisher.\n• Phisher speaks with the victim in the similar fashion/style as a bank employee,\nasking to verify that the victim is the customer of the bank. For example, \"Sir, we\nneed to make sure that you are indeed our customer. Could you please supply your\ncredit card information so that I can verify your identity”.\n• Phisher gets the required details swimmingly.\n6. Phone Phishing\n• Phisher can use a fake caller ID data to make it appear that the call is received\nfrom a trusted organization to entice the users to reveal their personal information\nsuch as account numbers and passwords.\n• Mishing- Mobile Phishing attacks (Vishing and Smishing)\nInnovative Phishing Attack Launched through Android Market\n• Android: It is an open-source operating system (OS) for mobile phones and is based\non Linux Kernel.\n• Its popular due to the release of Google’s Nexus One Phone.\n• Its Market is as popular as iPhone App Store. 22,000 applications available\n• https://news.spoftpedia.co  a malware writer succeeded to list a rogue Phishing\napplication called 09Droid on the Android Market website.\n• It found shell for mobile application, but later came to know that its being used to\nsteal Online Banking credentials.\n• Travsi Credit Union (TCU) issued an alert to all consumers regarding this malware\ninjection through 09Droid.Application was stealing financial information of\nconsumers.\n4.2.3 Spear Phishing\nWhat is spear Phishing?

Deceptive Phishing\n Phishing scams started by broadcasting deceptive E-Mail messages with objective of\nID theft.\n E-Mails are broadcasted to a wide group of netizens asking about the need to verify\nbanking account information/system failure requiring users to re-enter their personal\ninformation.\n The netizens easily get enticed and reveal their information by responding to these\nE-Mails and/or clicking on weblinks or signing onto a fake website designed by the\nphisher.\n2. Malware-based Phishing\n It refers to scams that involve running Malicious Code on the netizens system.\n Malware can be launched as an E-Mail attachment or as a downloadable file from a\nwebsite or by exploiting known security vulnerabilities.\n For example, small and medium businesses are always found to be ignorant to keep their\noperating systems (OS) antivirus software up to date with latest patch updates released\nby vendors.\n3. Keyloggers\n A small integrity program to steal information sends to phisher, keylogger log, to the\nphisher through the Internet.\n The keyloggers can also be embedded into netizen's browser as a small utility\nprogram which can start automatically when the browser is opened or can be\nembedded into system holes as device drivers.\n4. Session hijacking \n It is an attack in which netizens' activities are monitored until they establish their\nbonafide credentials by signing into their account or begin the transaction and at that\npoint the Malicious Code takes over and comport unauthorized actions such as\ntransferring funds without netizen's knowledge.\n5. In-session Phishing another parallel session in the same browser.:\n It is a Phishing attack based upon one web browsing session being able to detect the\npresence of another session (such as visit to an online banking website) on the same web\nbrowser and then a pop-up window is launched that pretends to be opened from the\ntargeted session\n6. Web Trojans\n Pops up to collect netizen's credentials and transmit them to the phisher while netizens\nare attempting to log in. Such pop-ups are usually invisible\n7. Pharming I\n It is a new threat evolved with a goal to steal online identity of the netizens and Pharming\n Is known as one of the \"P\" in cybercrime\n \nIn Pharming, following two techniques are used:\n Hosts file poisoning:\n The most popular operating system (OS) in the world is Windows and It has \"host names\"\nin their \"hosts\" file.\nJy othi R, Assistant Professor, Dept.of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) 13",

(before\nDNS)\n Phisher used to \"poison\" the host file to redirect the netizen to a fake/bogus Website,\ndesigned and developed by the phisher, which will \"look alike the original website, to\nSteal the netizen's personal information easily.\n DNS-based Phishing:\n Phisher tampers with a DNS so that requests for URLs or name service return a fake\naddress and subsequently netizens are directed to a fake site.\n Netizens usually are unaware that they are entering their personal confidential\ninformation in a website controlled by phishers and probably not even in the same\ncountry as the legitimate website.\n DNS-based Phishing is also known as DNS hijacking.\n Along with this attack Click Fraud is an advanced form of technique evolved to\nconduct Phishing scams.\n8. System configuration attacks:\n Phisher intrude into netizens system to modify settings for malicious purposes.\n For example, URLs saved under favourites in the browser De modified to redirect the\nnetizen to a fake/bogus \"look alike\" websites (i.e., URL for a of a bank can be changed\nfrom \"www.xyzbank.com to www.xyzbanc.com.).\n9. Data theft \n Critical and confidential data getting stolen is one of the biggest concerns in the\nmodern times.\n As more information resides on the corporate a servers and the web attackers have\na boom time because taking away/copying information in electronic form is easy.\n Unsecured systems are often found to be inappropriately maintained from\ncybersecurity perspective.\n When such system is connected, the web servers can launch an attack with\nnumerous methods and techniques. Data theft is used in business espionage.\n10. Content injection Phishing:\n In these types of scams, phisher replaces the part of the content of a legitimate\nwebsite with false content.\n11. Man-in-the middle Phishing:\n Phisher is positioned himself in between the netizens and legitimate website or\nsystem.\n Phisher records the input being provided by the netizen but continues to pass it on\nto the web server so that netizens transactions are nor affected.\n12. Search engine Phishing:\n It occurs when phishers create websites with attractive sounding offers (often\nfound too good to be true) and have them indexed legitimately with search\nengines.\n Netizens find websites during their normal course of search for products or\nservices and are trapped to reveal their personal information.\n For example, phishers set up fake/ bogus banking websites displaying an offer\nof lower credit costs or better interest rates than other banks offer of lower credit\ncosts or better interest rates than other banks.\nJy othi R, Assistant Professor, Dept.of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) 14",

Its takes hour together time.\n• Phishers have identified a way to invade the browser tabs and change it to a page\ndesigned to steal information.\n• If a page is ideal for a particular time period, and then phisher redirects the victim\nto a phished webpage.\n• Phisher judge the idle webpages based on mouse movement, scroll bar movement\nand keystrokes.\n• Websites from banking/financial institutes as well as popular sites like Gmail,\nFacebook, Instagram, WhatsApp are the primary targets.\nDNS Hijacking (session hijacking)\n• DNS Hijacking: It is also known as DNS redirection and it is the practice of\nredirecting the resolution of Domain Name Server (DNS) names to rogue DNS servers.\n• An illegal change to a DNS server directs URL to a different website.\n• In some cases, new websites URL may have done one different letter in the name that\nmight go unnoticed. The bogus website might offer similar and/or competing\nproducts for sale.\n• DNS is used to interpret domain names such as www. <domainname>.com into an IP\naddress.

The caller who makes a \"cold call\"\n(supposedly from a bank) asks the victim to verify account information immediately\non the phone, often without m explanation or verification. This attack is known as\nVishing.\nComputer-based technique\nThese techniques are attempts made by the attacker to exploit the vulnerabilities\nwithin existing processes and/or systems.\n Backup theft: In addition to stealing equipment from private buildings,\nattackers also strike public facilities such as transport areas, hotels and\nrecreation centres. They carefully analyse stolen equipment or backups to\nrecover the data.\n• Hacking unauthorized access to systems and database theft: Besides stealing\nthe equipment and/or hardware criminals attempt to compromise\ninformation systems with various tools, techniques and methods to gain\nunauthorized access to download the required information.\n• Phishing: It is an attack that attempts to steal money or identity by getting victim to\nreveal personal information.\n• Pharming: It is a scamming practice in which malicious code is installed on a\npersonal computer or server misdirecting users to fraudulent websites without their\nknowledge or consent.

[PDA (Personal Digital\nAssistance), mobile Phones, iPods]\n• Use of data mining in cyber forensics, forensics auditing and anti-forensics.\n5.2 Historical Background of Cyberforensics,\n• The Florida Computer Crimes Act was the first computer crime law to address computer\nfraud and intrusion. It was enacted in Florida in 1978.\n• The application of computer for investigating computer-based crime has led to development\nof a new field called computer forensics. Sometimes, computer forensics is also referred to\nas \"digital forensics.\n\"Forensics evidence\" is important in the investigation of Cyber-crimes.\n• Computer Forensics needs DIGITAL EVIDENCE, in cases involving data\nacquisition, preservation, recovery, analysis and reporting, intellectual property\ntheft, computer misuses corporate policy violation, mobile device (PDA, cell\nphone) data acquisition and analysis, malicious software/application, system\nintrusion and compromise, encrypted, deleted and hidden files recovery\npornography, confidential information leakage etc.,\n• The focus of Computer Forensics is to find out digital evidence.\n• DE is required to establish whether or a fraud or crime has been conducted.\nComputer forensics\n• Computer forensics is primarily concerned with the systematic identification, acquisition\npreservation and analysis of digital evidence, typically after an unauthorized access to\ncomputer or unauthorized use of computer has taken place:\nJyot hi R, Assistant Professor, Dept. of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) 1",

There is a number of slightly varying\ndefinitions/The term computer forensics, however, is generally considered to be related to the use\nof analytical and investigative techniques to identify, collect, examine and preserve\nevidence/information which is magnetically stored or encoded\nThe objective of \"Cyberforensics\" is to provide digital evidence of a specific or general activity.\nFollowing are two more definitions worth considering:\n1. Computer forensics: It is the lawful and ethical seizure, acquisition, analysis, reporting\nand safeguarding of data and metadata derived from digital devices which may contain\ninformation that is notable and perhaps of evidentiary value to the trier of fact in\nmanagerial, administrative, civil and criminals' investigations. In other words, it is the\ncollection of techniques and tools used to find evidence in a computer.\n2.

(Some researchers prefer to\nexpand the definition by including the \"collection\" and \"examination\" of all forms of digital\ndata, including the data found in cell phones, PDAs, iPods and other electronic devices. In\ngeneral, the role of digital forensics is to:\n.\n1. Uncover and document evidence and leads.\n2. Corroborate evidence discovered in other ways (E-Discovery)\n3. Assist in showing a pattern of events (data mining has an application here).\n4. Connect attack and victim computers (Locard's Exchange Principle)\n5.

The increasing dependence of law enforcement on digital evidence.\n2. Ubiquity of computers that followed from the microcomputer revolution.\n⯈ The media on which clues related to cybercrime reside may vary from case to case.\n⯈ There are many challenges for the forensics investigator because storage devices are\ngetting miniaturized due to advances in electronic technology; for example, external\nstorage devices such as mini hard disks (pen drives) are available in amazing shapes.\n⯈ Looking for digital forensics evidence (DFE) is like looking for a needle in the\nhaystack.\n⯈ Here is a way to illustrate why there is always the need for forensics software on suspect\nmedia - the capacity of a typical regular hard disk is 500 GB (gigabytes).\n⯈ In an A4 size page, there are approximately 4,160 bytes (52 lines x 80 Characters =\n4160 bytes assuming 1 byte per character). This is equivalent to 4 KB (kilobytes).

However, this is not true; the traditional\nprinciples of leading evidence, along with certain newly added provisions in the Indian Evidence\nAct 1972 through the Information Technology Act (ITA) 2000, constitute the body of law\napplicable to electronic evidence. The challenges, however, need to be understood from the \"rules\nof evidence\" perspective.\nPaper evidence, the process is clear and intuitively obvious. Digital evidence by its very nature\nInvisible to the eye. Therefore, the evidence must be developed using tools other than the is human\neye.\nThere are number of contexts involved in actually identifying a piece of digital evidence:\n1. Physical context: It must be definable in its physical form, that is, it should reside on a\nspecific piece of media.\n2. Logical context: It must be identifiable as to its logical position, that is, where does it\nreside relative to the file system.\n3. Legal context: We must place the evidence in the correct context to read its meaning, this\nmay require looking at the evidence as machine language, for example, American Standard\nCode for Information Interchange (ASCII).\nThe path taken by digital evidence can be conceptually depicted as shown in Fig. 5.3.\nFig. 5.3: Path of the digital evidence.\nJyo thi R, Assistant Professor, Dept. of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) 10",

Handling of digital evidence requires special expertise that come from training\nand experience.\nA forensics expert team brings the following additional benefits:\n1. Technology expertise:\nThis is perhaps the biggest advantage of partnership with a computer forensics expert. As an\nexample of the technological complexity, consider the proliferation of operating systems in the last\ndecade: mainframe operating systems, Windows 95/98, UNIX, Linux, Windows NT, Windows\nServer, Macintosh, Windows 2000, Windows XP and Novell Netware. Specific forensics tools\nmust be used with each of these file systems, along with training and experience to interpret search\nresults. Although some evidence may be found easily, other evidence may have been deleted,\naltered, hidden or encrypted. Forensics experts routinely deal with such complexities and\nnuances.\n2. Forensics methodology: A comprehensive forensics methodology, repeatable and\ndefensible, has become a key attribute in choosing a forensics expert firm. Proper use of a\nrepeatable process prevents making the same mistake twice, ensures proper chain of custody,\nleverages successful techniques from prior cases, supports clear and concise testimony, and\ngenerally guarantees efficient forensics case management.\n3. Experience and efficiency: The tools and methods of computer forensics examination are still\nin their infancy. Experts know how to quickly navigate through the variety of esoteric tools and\nprocedures. Experts also have the experience to cull thousands of files based on patterns and\nkeywords. Therefore, working with experts will efficiently produce relevant results for counsel.\nJyo thi R, Assistant Professor, Dept. of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) 15",

Network\npackers can be examined using the OSI Model to interpret the raw data into an application-\nlevel scream.\nAnalysis types are\nOS analysis: An OS is an application; it is the first one that is run when a computer starts.\nThis analysis examines another configuration file and output data of the OS to determine\nwhat events may be occurred.\nExecutable analysis:\nexecutables are digital object that can cause events to occur and their frequently\nexamine during intrusion investigation because the investigator needs to determine what\nevents the executable could cause\n6. Image analysis:\nimage is a single searchable file.\nDigital images are the target of many digital investigations because some are Contraband.\nthis type of analysis Looks for information about where the picture was taken and who\nare what is in the picture image analysis also includes examining images for evidence of\nsteganography\n7. Video analysis\ndigital radio is used in security cameras and then personal videos cameras and webcams\ninvestigation of online predators can sometimes involve digital video from webcams this type\nof analysis examine the video for identification of objects in the video and the location\nwhere it was shot\nBox: 5.11 The RAID Levels\nRAID data acquisitions are performed as a part of Computer forensic. RAID\nstands for redundant array of independent discs.\nIt is category of disc drive that employees' multiple drives in combination for fault\ntolerance and performance.\nThe use of raid describe is frequent on servers, the uses not generally necessary for\npersonal computer.\nstorage technology had become too expensive to place a large number of high-capacity hard\ndrive in the servers.\nthe response to the situation came through the concept of raid subsequently rate become very\npopular.\nNote that data stripping me spreading out block for each file access multiple disc drives. It was\na system developed as a solution to link together a large number of low-cost hard drive with a view\nto form a single large capacity storage device that provided superior performance storage capacity\nand reliability as compared to the older storage solutions. since then, RAID become widely\nused and is deployed as an enterprise storage method in server market.\nAttractiveness of RAID comes from the fat that the array of disc distributed the data across multiple\ndiscs. however, the computer user and operating system to the serve such. The different RAID\nlevels are\nlevel 0: this is nothing but a strip would Disc a rate without fault tolerance. it provides data\nstripping but no redundancy. this results in an improved performance however it does not\ndeliver fault tolerance all data in the array is lost if one drive fails.\nJyo thi R, Assistant Professor, Dept. of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) 22",

Forensic nvestigation professionals know that if you do not have a chain of custody, the\nevidence is worthless. They learn to deal with everything as if it would go to litigation.\nPurpose of the chain of custody is that the proponent of a piece of evidence must demonstrate that\nit is what it purports to be.\nIn other words, there is a reliable information to suggest that the party offering the evidence\ncan demonstrate the piece of evidence is actually, in fact, what the party claims it to be and\ncan further demonstrate its origin and the handling of the evidence because it was acquired.\nThe Chain of Custody is a chronological written record of those individuals who have had\ncustody of the evidence from, its initial acquisition until its final disposition.\nA chain of custody begins when an item of relevant evidence is collected, and the chain is\nmaintained until the evidence is disposed off (Figs. 5.10 and 5.11). The chain of custody\nassumes continuous accountability. This accountability is important because, if not properly\nmaintained, an item (of evidence) may be inadmissible\n5.8 Network forensics.\n• Open networks can be source of many network-based cyberattack\n• Wireless Forensics\n• Wireless Forensics is a discipline included within the computer forensics science, and\nspecifically, within the network forensics field.\n• The goal of wireless forensics is to provide the methodology and) tools required to collect\nnetwork traffic that can be presented as valid digital evidence a court of law.\nJyo thi R, Assistant Professor, Dept. of ISE Introduction to Cyber Security (BETCK105I/205I) 27",
