HOW TO DATA ON YOUR DEVICES
A burglary, lost laptop, stolen mobile phone, or misplaced flash drive — all can happen due to
lapses in physical security. But they’re less likely to result in a data breach if information on those
devices is protected. Here are a few ways to do that:
Require complex passwords
Require passwords that are long, complex, and unique. And make sure that these
passwords are stored securely. Consider using a password manager.
Use multi-factor authentication
Require multi-factor authentication to access areas of your network with sensitive
information. This requires additional steps beyond logging in with a password — like
a temporary code on a smartphone or a key that’s inserted into a computer.
Limit login attempts
Limit the number of incorrect login attempts allowed to unlock devices. This will help
protect against intruders.
Encrypt
Encrypt portable media, including laptops and thumb drives, that contain sensitive
information. Encrypt any sensitive data you send outside of the company, like to an
accountant or a shipping service.
TRAIN Include physical security in your regular employee trainings and
communications. Remind employees to:
