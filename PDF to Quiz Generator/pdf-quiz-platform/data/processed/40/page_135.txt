Digital analysis is very important in Digital forensic because a digital investigation may encounter
many forms of digital data and therefore there is a several types of digital analysis.
The different analysis types are based on interpretation obstruction layers which are generally part of
the data design.
For example, consider the date on a hard disc which has been designed with several interpretation
layers lowest layer me contain partitions or other containers that are used for volume management.
Inside each partition is data that has been organised into a file system or database.
Data in the file system is interpreted to create file that contain data in an application specific format
and requirement
What are the common digital analysis types:
1. Media analysis: It is analysis of the data from a storage device. This analysis does not
consider any partitions or other operating system (OS)-specific data structures. If the
storage device uses a fixed size unit, such as a sector, then it can be used in this analysis.
2. Media management analysis: It is analysis of the management system use d to organize
media. This typically involves partitions and may include volume management or redundant
array of independent (or inexpensive) disks (RAID, see Box 5.11) systems chat merge data
from multiple storage devices into a single virtual storage device.
3. File system analysis: It is the analysis of the file system data inside a partition or disk.
This typically involves processing the data to extract the contents of a fil e or to recover the
contents of a deleted files.
4. Application analysis: It is the analysis of the data inside a file. Files are created by users
and applications. The format of the contents is application-specific.
