and may hang the system. This attack can crash various OSs due to a bug in their TCP/IP
fragmentation reassembly code.
5. Smurf attack: This is a type of DoS attack that floods a target system via spoofed
broadcast ping messages. This attack consists of a host sending an echo request (ping) to
a network broadcast address.
6. Nuke: Nuke is an old DoS attack against computer networks consisting of fragmented or
invalid packets sent to the target.
Tools Used to Launch DoS Attack
1. Jolt2 : The vulnerability allows remote attackers to cause a DoS attack against Windows-
based machines – the attack causes the target machine to consume of the CPU time on
processing of illegal packets.
2. Nemesy : This program generates random packets of spoofed source IP to enable the
attacker to launch DoS attack.
3. Targa : It is a program that can be used to run eight different DoS attacks. The attacker
has the option to launch either individual attacks or try all the attacks until one is successful.
4. Crazy Pinger : This tool could send large packets of ICMP(Internet Control Message
Protocol) to a remote target network.
5. SomeTrouble: It is a remote flooder and bomber. It is developed in Delphi.
DDoS Attacks
 In a DDoS attack, an attacker may use your computer to attack another computer.
 By taking advantage of security vulnerabilities or weaknesses, an attacker could take
control of your computer.
 He/she could then force your computer to send huge amounts of data to a website or send
Spam to particular E-Mail addresses.
 The attack is “distributed” because the attacker is using multiple computers, including
yours, to launch the DoS attack.
 A DDoS attack is a distributed DoS wherein a large number of zombie systems are
synchronized to attack a particular system.
