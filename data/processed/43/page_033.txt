Cracker: A cracker is a person who breaks into computers. Crackers should not be confused
with hackers. The term “cracker” is usually connected to computer criminals. Some of their
crimes include vandalism, theft and snooping in unauthorized areas.
Cracking: It is the act of breaking into computers. Cracking is a popular, growing subject on the
Internet. Many sites are devoted to supplying crackers with programs that allow them to crack
computers. Some of these programs contain dictionaries for guessing passwords. Others are used
to break into phone lines (called “phreaking”). These sites usually display warnings such as
“These files are illegal; we are not responsible for what you do with them.”
Cracker tools: These are programs used to break into computers. Cracker tools are widely
distributed on the Internet. They include password crackers, Trojans, viruses, war dialers and
worms.
Phreaking: This is the notorious art of breaking into phone or other communication systems.
Phreaking sites on the Internet are popular among crackers and other criminals.
War dialer: Program automatically dials phone numbers looking for computers on the other
end. It catalogs numbers so that the hackers can call back and try to break in. An attacker would
look to exploit the vulnerabilities in the networks, most often so because the networks are not
adequately protected.
 The categories of vulnerabilities that hackers typically search for are the following:
o Inadequate border protection (border as in the sense of network periphery);
o remote access servers (RASs) with weak access controls;
