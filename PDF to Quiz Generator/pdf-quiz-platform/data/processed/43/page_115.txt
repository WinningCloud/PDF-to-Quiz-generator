Understanding Computer Forensics
Understanding Computer Forensics: Introduction, Historical Background of
Cyberforensics, Digital Forensics Science, Need for Computer Forensics, Cyber Forensics and
Digital Evidence, Digital Forensic Life cycle, Chain of Custody Concepts, network forensics.
5.1 Introduction,
• Cyber forensics plays role in investigation of cybercrime.
• Evidence in the case of Cyber offenses is extremely important from legal perspective.
• There are legal aspects involved in the investigation as well as handling of the digital
forensics evidence.
• Technically trained and experienced experts are involved in the forensics activities.
• Use of hand-held devices are incensing now a days. [PDA (Personal Digital
Assistance), mobile Phones, iPods]
• Use of data mining in cyber forensics, forensics auditing and anti-forensics.
5.2 Historical Background of Cyberforensics,
• The Florida Computer Crimes Act was the first computer crime law to address computer
fraud and intrusion. It was enacted in Florida in 1978.
• The application of computer for investigating computer-based crime has led to development
of a new field called computer forensics. Sometimes, computer forensics is also referred to
as "digital forensics.
"Forensics evidence" is important in the investigation of Cyber-crimes.
• Computer Forensics needs DIGITAL EVIDENCE, in cases involving data
acquisition, preservation, recovery, analysis and reporting, intellectual property
theft, computer misuses corporate policy violation, mobile device (PDA, cell
phone) data acquisition and analysis, malicious software/application, system
intrusion and compromise, encrypted, deleted and hidden files recovery
pornography, confidential information leakage etc.,
• The focus of Computer Forensics is to find out digital evidence.
• DE is required to establish whether or a fraud or crime has been conducted.
Computer forensics
• Computer forensics is primarily concerned with the systematic identification, acquisition
preservation and analysis of digital evidence, typically after an unauthorized access to
computer or unauthorized use of computer has taken place:
