often some difficulty is faced in estimating the losses because the financial impacts may not be detectedby the
victimized organization and no direct costs may be associated with the data theft. The 2008 CSI Surveyon
computer crime and security supports this. Cybercrimes occupy an important space in information security domain
because of their impact. The other challenge comes from the difficulty in attaching a quantifiable monetary value
to the corporate data and yet corporate data get stolen/lost (through loss/theft of laptops).
Because of these reasons, reporting of financial losses often remains approximate. In an attempt to avoid
negative publicity, most organizations abstain from revealing facts and figures about “security incidents” including
cybercrime. In general, organizations perception about “insider attacks” seems to be different thanthat made
out by security solution vendor. However, this perception of an organization does not seem to be trueas revealed
by the 2008 CSI Survey. Awareness about “data privacy” too tends to be low in most organizations. When we
speak of financial losses to the organization and significant insider crimes, such as leaking customer data, such
“crimes” may not be detected by the victimized organization and no direct costs may be associated with the theft
