Network security components often include:
1. Anti-virus and anti-spyware
2. Firewall, to block unauthorized access to your network
3. Intrusion prevention systems (IPS), to identify fast-spreading threats, such as zero-day or zero-hour attacks
4. Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), to provide secure remote access
V. CONCLUSION
While the age-old concept of the network is foundational in virtually all areas of society, Computer Networks and
Protocols have forever changed the way humans will work, play, and communicate. Forging powerfully into areas of our
lives that no one had expected, digital networking is further empowering us for the future. New protocols and standards
will emerge, new applications will be conceived, and our lives will be further changed and enhanced. While the new will
only be better, the majority of digital networking's current technologies are not cutting-edge, but rather are protocols and
standards conceived at the dawn of the digital networking age that have stood solid for over thirty years.
