 The zombie systems are called “secondary victims” and the main target is called
“primary victim.”
 Malware can carry DDoS attack mechanisms – one of the better-known examples of this
is MyDoom.
 Botnet is the popular medium to launch DoS/DDoS attacks.
 Attackers can also break into systems using automated tools that exploit flaws in
programs that listen for connections from remote hosts.
How to Protect from DoS/DDoS Attacks
Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center (CERT/CC) offers many
preventive measures from being a victim of DoS attack.
1. Implement router filters. This will lessen your exposure to certain DoS attacks.
2. If such filters are available for your system, install patches to guard against TCP SYN
flooding.
3. Disable any unused or inessential network service.
4. Enable quota systems on your OS if they are available.
5. Observe your system’s performance and establish baselines for ordinary activity.
6. Routinely examine your physical security with regard to your current needs.
7. Use Tripwire or a similar tool to detect changes in configuration information or other
files.
8. Invest in and maintain “hot spares” – machines that can be placed into service quickly if a
similar machine is disabled.
9. Invest in redundant and fault-tolerant network configurations.
10. Establish and maintain regular backup schedules
11. Establish and maintain appropriate password policies
Attacks on Wireless Networks
 Wireless technologies have become increasingly popular in day-to-day business and
personal lives.
 Hand-held devices such as the PDAs allow individuals to access calendars, E-Mail
addresses, phone number lists and the Internet.
 Wireless networks extend the range of traditional wired networks by using radio waves to
