Backdoor
 A backdoor is a means of access to a computer program that bypasses security mechanisms.
A programmer may sometimes install a backdoor so that the program can be accessed for
troubleshooting or other purposes.
 However, attackers often use backdoors that they detect or install themselves as part of an
exploit.
 In some cases, a worm is designed to take advantage of a backdoor created by an earlier
attack.
 A backdoor works in background and hides from the user.
 It is very similar to a virus and, therefore, is quite difficult to detect and completely disable.
 A backdoor is one of the most dangerous parasite, as it allows a malicious person to
perform any possible action on a compromised system.
Following are some functions of backdoor:
1. It allows an attacker to create, delete, rename, copy or edit any file, execute various
commands; change any system settings; alter the Windows registry; run, control and
terminate applications; install arbitrary software and parasites.
2. It allows an attacker to control computer hardware devices, modify related settings,
shutdown or restart a computer without asking for user permission.
3. It steals sensitive personal information, valuable documents, passwords, login names, ID
details; logs user activity and tracks web browsing habits.
