 Dilute in Hydrogen Fluoride (HF) solution. The resist, which is guarding the oxide layer and the region
that are now exposed to radiation, will get removed. This technique is termed as etching.
 Compare patterns on the wafer with the mask. The patterns that are opaque are same as present on the
wafer.
Area 2: The pattern on the photoresist becomes hard. In that case the pattern on the wafer will be negative and
will be compliment to the pattern on the mask, which is denoted as negative resist.
Figure 2. Procedure for Lithography
Precautions
The following are the precautions that need to be undertaken while creating integrated circuits using
Lithography:
1. Dimensions of the pattern should be correct on the photo mask.
2. Transfer the pattern from the photo mask on the wafer carefully.
3. Photoresist should stick properly on the substrate because when photoresist is peeled off the pattern may
get damage and become of no use.
4. The pattern fixed on the wafer should be aligned accurately as Lithography process can be carried out
multiple times in a day.
