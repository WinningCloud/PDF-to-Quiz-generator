Today the world is dominated by\nsilicon, which has circumscribed chip development for computers through microprocessors. Majority of the integrated\ncircuits that are manufactured at present are developed using the concept of Lithography. This paper presents a detailed\nanalysis of multiple Lithography methodologies as a means for advanced integrated circuit development. The study paper\nprimarily restricts to examples in the context of Lithography, surveying the various existing techniques of Lithography in\nliterature, examining feasible and efficient methods, highlighting the various pros and cons of each of them.\nKEYWORDS\nEtching, Lithography, Mirrors, Resist, Poly Silicon, Transistor & Wafer.\n1. INTRODUCTION\nIn 1950’s chip manufacturers discovered that as the complexity of the circuits grew they faced new challenges\n[2]. One was while building a circuit, all the connections should be intact otherwise the current would be\nstopped within the circuit. Another problem was the speed complexity of the circuits. The circuits used in\ncomputers primarily depend upon speed. If the components used in computers are too large or the wires joining\nthem are too long, then in that case the speed will become slow and get affected. In 1958 Jack Kilby established\nan answer to this problem. He made all the parts from the same block of material and added a layer of metal on\ntop of it to connect them together. As a result no more of wires and components had to be assembled manually.\nThe circuits could easily be made smaller and the manufacturing process could be computerized. Integrated\ncircuits have come long way since the Jack Kilby’s first model. His idea changed the future of microprocessor\nindustry and is the key element behind our computer society.\nIntegrated circuit is considered as the advanced form of electrical circuit. Different electrical components\nincluding transistors, capacitors, diodes and capacitors make an electrical circuit. These components act as\nbuilding blocks in an electrical manufacture gear. It can help us construct computer microprocessor or burglar\nalarm. The advent of integrated circuits (ICs) technology facilitated the placement of large number of\ntransistors on a single chip, thereby playing an important role in solving problems of logic circuits by\nimproving power consumption and speed performance.\nToday most advanced circuits can be developed with billions of transistors embedded in them [5]. Every year as\nthe technology is advancing; the chips are becoming more powerful and cheaper.\nPage | 520 Copyright @ 2019 Authors",

OVERVIEW OF LITHOGRAPHY\nThe term Lithography [3] originates from Greek words lithos meaning “stones” and graphia meaning\n“writing”. In today’s semiconductor industry it is used to design 3-D images on a substrate. It is a process of\nimprinting a geometric pattern from a mask onto a thin layer of materials called resist. The technology plays an\nimportant role in the production of electronic device components such as integrated circuits. Figure 1 shows the\nclassification of lithography.\nPage | 521 Copyright @ 2019 Authors",

Wafer / Substrate: The substance on which pattern of integrated circuits are developed by different steps\nof lithography\n2. Photoresist: Is a photosensitive film placed on the top of the wafer There are two\ntypes of photoresist:-\n Positive Photo resist: Becomes more soluble in developer solution when exposed to radiation.\n Negative Photo resist: Becomes less soluble in developer solution when exposed to radiation.\n3. Pattern: It is the image of the integrated circuit that has to be printed on the wafer\nProcedure\nThe following are the steps involved in creation of integrated circuits using lithography (Figure2):\nStep 1: Coat the wafer with poly silicon liquid and place the photo resist layer on top of it.\nStep 2: Expose the photoresist-coated wafer to proper radiation. Project a light on the mask containing the\npattern. Expose the light on the wafer with or without a mask. Some patterns on the mask are opaque and some\nare transparent to the radiation falling on them, so when the light falls on the mask only those regions which are\ntransparent will allow the light to pass through it and fall on the wafer. Different resist have different properties.\nProperties of only those resist will change which are exposed to proper radiation and later become soft or hard.\nStep 3: Developing stage involves two areas:\nArea 1: Photo resist becomes soft to radiation.\n Place the resist in a developer solution for easy detachment.

LITHOGRAPHY METHODOLOGIES\nElectron Beam Lithography\nElectron Beam Lithography was discovered around 1960s in order to scan small objects with electrons and\neasily modify the patterns. The process of E-Beam Lithography involves bending of electrons using force as\ncompared to conventional lithographic approach of bending light using mirrors [8]. This method is mask less\nwhere the substrate is directly written upon like a pen.\nThere are two types of forces involved\n Electromagnetic\n Electrostatic\nBoth of these forces are used to manufacture lenses that include electromagnetic and electrostatic lenses, which\nare used to focus light. In the following subsections the procedure used to create pattern on the substrate using\nE-Beam Lithography is discussed.\nProcedure\nThe following are the steps involved in creation of integrated circuits using E-Beam Lithography\nStep 1: E-Beam with a diameter of 0.01µ to 0.5µ is focused and scanned over the entire semiconductor\nsubstrate with a computer depending on the pattern that has to be created on the substrate. Since we use\ncomputer here, so it requires blanking (it controls the electron beam with the help of a computer and turns off\nand on accordingly) and deflection.\nStep 2: The E-Beam is operated in two modes - one where the E-Beam Resist is eradiated changing its\nproperties and other when off, the resist is not eradiated. The movement of the E- Beam is over a small region,\nwhich is referred as scanned field.\nStep 3: Usually the size of the field is 1cm by 1cm whereas the size of the substrate is bigger in comparison.\nOnce the E-Beam scans the substrate once, then the substrate gets moved, as a result the substrate is mounted\nover a movable X-Y table.\nStep 4: Hence during the second time when the E-Beam is scanned over the unexposed regions of the substrate,\npatterns are created easily on it.\nWriting Strategies\nFollowing are the writing strategies for the creation of integrated circuits using E-Beam Lithography\n1. Raster Scan: Scans the whole substrate pixel element by pixel element. It is a slow process and\nblanking is used when to write the pattern or not on the substrate accordingly. Spot size (smallest\nsize that can be made on electrons and electron’s numerical aperture. It defines the size ranging\nbetween 0.1 to 5 created over numerical aperture) plays an important role in writing since it gives\ndirect tradeoff between throughput and resolution. The small spot size will provide better resolution\nwhereas large spot size will provide higher throughput.\n2. Vector Scan: Used only on the selected areas on the substrate where writing is to be performed and\nprovides thinly dispersed and not dense patterns on the substrate.\nPage | 524 Copyright @ 2019 Authors",

Variable shaped beam: Projects a rectangle on the entire wafer at one time. These rectangles\nusually are of order 1 micron or half micron, so can easily adjust the width and height to get variety\nof shapes. This technique is used widely for the production of masks since it gives better\nthroughput and resolution as compared to other techniques.\nAdvantages\n E-Beam Lithography is designed in such a manner that it delivers optimum performance in the field of\nresearch and development sector since it is automated and we can easily change the pattern when we\nwant and is used in manufacturing masks.\n We obtain less throughput and high resolution.\nLimitations\n Dissolving Issues: E-beam resists are organic materials which upon eradication of negative resist create\ncross linkage monomers and change the molecular weight at the same time. Making it heavy and\ndifficult to dissolve in the developer solution.\n Slow Process: Since the diameter of the electron beam is very small only a small scanned area will be\nfocused over and hence will take a longer time to write on the entire substrate [9].\n Proximity Effect: Different portions on the substrate have to be exposed for different amount of time.\nFigure shows two points A and B where A will receive the maximum electron beam when exposed and\nsince point B is far from point A and will receive a very low amount of electron beam. This is termed as\nProximity Effect. Since electron beam are used to write onto a small area of the substrate, multiple\nbeams are being considered. Multiple beams are used altogether in parallel to write on the substrate and\ndevelop patterns easily. This helps to develop masks quickly but practically hasn’t been demonstrated\nyet.\nX-Ray Lithography\nWilhelm Conrad Roentgen discovered an unknown ray in 1895 (X-Ray) that can cause barium platinocyanide\ncoated screen to glow. He won the first Nobel Prize in physics in 1901. In X-Ray Lithography X-Ray light is\napplied to generate the pattern on the substrate. Resolution is a function of wavelength and shorter the\nwavelength higher will be the resolution. Proximity printing is applied, where some gap is maintained between\nthe substrate and the X-Ray mask. The technique is developed to the extent of batch processing. The method is\nsimple to use since it requires no lenses. This technique originated as an advanced tool for next generation\nlithography for the semiconductor industry with batches of microprocessors successfully produced. Figure 3\nbelow depicts how x-ray lithography is carried out.\nPage | 525 Copyright @ 2019 Authors",

Procedure for X-Ray Lithography\nProcedure\nThese are the steps that are to be followed during X-Ray Lithography:\nStep 1: The source emits X-Ray light onto the X-Ray mask containing the pattern to be printed.\nStep 2: X- Ray masks contain two important structures:\n Absorber: Contains the information to be imaged onto the resist. Since gold has a low atomic no\nand is a good absorbing material, it is applied on the top of the x- ray mask. High atomic\nnumber material absorbs X-Rays whereas low atomic number material transmits X-Rays.\n Membrane: X-Ray masks consist of a very thin membrane of low atomic number material\ncarrying a high atomic number thick absorber pattern.\nStep 3: X-Ray resist are of two types as shown in Figure 3:\n Positive resist: Which become soluble when exposed to X-Ray light in the developer solution.\nExample: PMMA and PBS. PMMA produces a resolution less than 0.1 whereas PBS produces\na resolution of 0.5 [10]\n Negative resist: The portion, which is exposed to light, doesn’t dissolve in the developer\nsolution. Example: COP (An epoxy copolymer of glycidyl methacrylate and ethyl acrylate)\nwhich produces a resolution of 1.0.\nFigure 4.Types of X-Ray Resist\nAdvantages\n Reduces the limit of diffraction since shorter wavelength of light is used.\n It can produce feature size as small as 20nm.\n It produces high resolution and less through put.\nPage | 526 Copyright @ 2019 Authors",

It is\nused in mass-production of ICs with minimum feature size of 250-350 nm. There are three ways of printing in\noptical Lithography onto the wafer:\nFigure 5. Types of Printing in Optical Lithography\n1. Contact Printing: In Contact Printing the wafer and the mask come in close contact with each other, which\nmakes the life of mask very low but creates a high resolution. It makes use of u- v light of wavelength 300-\n400nm. It operates in the Fresnel Diffraction pattern (used to calculate the diffraction pattern created by\nwaves passing through an aperture or around an object). The tools used here are optical system, wafer,\nphotoresist film and mask. When the light passes through the optical system, it makes the light incident on\nthe glass pate. The silicon wafer is coated with photoresist film.\nAdvantages\n Contact printing provides good resolution of images of about 1 to 0.5µm.\n It is easy to operate and maintain the equipment.\nDisadvantages\n Masks may get damaged due to contact with the wafer for a long time, so this technique is only limited\nto research labs or applications that can tolerate the defects.\n2. Proximity Printing: In proximity printing a gap is maintained between the mask and the wafer, which\nmakes the life of the mask better but does not provide great resolution. This can help in minimizing the\nmask getting damaged but still dust particles may be present and\nPage | 527 Copyright @ 2019 Authors",

It operates in the Fresnel diffraction pattern (used to calculate the diffraction\npattern created by waves passing through an aperture or around an object) where resolution is proportional\nto is the wavelength of light exposed and g is the gap between the mask and the wafer, since g\nis less here in comparison to contact printing it leads to poor resolution.\nAdvantages\n Mask are less defect prone than in pure (hard) contact.\nDisadvantages\n It is hard to align and will lose some resolution of images due to the small gap between the mask and\nthe wafer resulting in diffraction at feature edges.\n3. Projection Printing: In projection printing the distance between the mask and the wafer isn’t constrained\nbecause the pattern on the photo mask is projected directly on the resist coated wafer and there is no chance\nof the mask getting damaged as the mask and the wafer are placed far away from each other. It operates in\nthe Fraunhofer diffraction pattern (used to model the diffraction of waves when the diffraction pattern is\nviewed at a long distance from the bending object). In order to obtain an image of high resolution, only a\nsmall amount of pattern is projected and for a defect free lens system Rayleigh limit formula is applied\n0.6 λ NA where λ is the wavelength used and NA is the numerical aperture of the lens system used.\nAdvantages\n Provides high resolution of images.\n There is no damage to mask.\nDisadvantages\n Complex equipment requires high maintenance\n Provides low throughput\n Requires an environmental chamber for controlling Temperature,\nhumidity and reducing noise\nThere are two types of optical Lithography: DUV (Deep Ultra Violet Light) and EUV (Extreme Ultra Violet\nLight) which are discussed in the following subsections.\nDeep Ultraviolet Lithography\nDeep Ultraviolet Lithography reduces minimum feature size of the integrated circuits by 50nm. 200-300nm\nreplaces wavelengths of 250-350nm. We use excimer light sources (used in production of microelectronic\ndevices) to generate DUV light [4]. Currently 248nm (KrF) and 193nm (ArF) excimer lasers [6] are used for\ndevelopment and volume manufacturing of ICs. It is also used for commercial purposes where xenon mercury\nlamps with low intensity are used [7].\nPage | 528 Copyright @ 2019 Authors",

We can fabricate 200 or 1000 chips\ninstead of one easily.\n Wide ranges of resists are available.\nDisadvantages:\n Since the wavelength of light is getting smaller, glasses lenses designed to focus the light rather absorb\nthe light and very less light is able to reach on the silicon wafer.\n Lack of availability of lamps.\n A mismatch can occur between the lamp and the resist used.\nExtreme Ultraviolet Lithography\nIn order to keep pace with growing demands of manufacturing small feature size integrated chips, a new way of\nreducing the wavelength has been discovered using Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography. Deep ultra violet\nLithography used radiation of wavelength of 248 nm to print the small-scale features on the wafer. Resolution =\nK1×λ\nWhere λ is the wavelength and NA is the numerical aperture. K1 here is 0.25, since below that double\npatterning has to be applied which is costly and numerical aperture should not exceed 1.35 as it requires high\nindex lenses and fluid which are not currently available.\nResolution = 0.25×193 = 36nm\nOne of the important Problems is reducing the wavelength of light and extreme ultraviolet Lithography comes\ninto the picture and plays an important role in optical Lithography.\nProcedure\nStep 1: Wavelength of 13.5nm is used for EUV. In order to produce such small wavelength, an excited state\natom is required and therefore tin (Sn) is commonly used which is already highly positively charged. Vacuum\nplays an important role since wavelength of light is so small that it can easily be absorbed by air. Accordingly\neverything ranging from optics to mask is placed inside a vacuum to generate plasma.\nStep 2: There are two methods through which high-energy photons can be generated for making the pattern on\nthe wafer [11]. Figure 6 shows the layout for producing EUV Lithography.\na. Laser Pulsed Plasma:\ni. A pulse laser is fired onto the incoming tin (Sn) droplets which puts these droplets in the excited\nstate and when comes to relaxed state generates EUV photons. A mirror focuses these photons to an\nintermediate focus (If) and passes it to the next level. The size of the tiny tin (Sn) droplets is usually\nof diameter 50-100μm.\nb. Discharged Pulsed Plasma:\ni. Plasma can also be produced by Discharged rather than laser pulsed plasma where two tin baths are\nused which are filled by molten tin and two disks are placed which rotate and pick up tin on their\nsurface when rotated in tin bath. Apply voltage and throw laser which puts the tin to an excited state\nand when it comes to relaxed state it generates EUV photons.\nPage | 529 Copyright @ 2019 Authors",

Layout for producing EUV Lithography\nStep 3: After the photons get generated, concave and convex mirrors and not glasses are used since it does not\nrefract instead reflect.\nStep 4: A mask, which contains the pattern, is acted upon by light, which is focused onto the particular pattern\nwhile some light passes through it without even touching the pattern. EUV Lithography involves reflective\noptics as well as reflective mask and Brag reflector is used to make this happen.\nStep 5: Brag Reflector: Each of the mirrors contain alternate layers of molybdenum (Mo) and silicon layers\nwhich give a reflection of about 70 percent and together form a brag reflector and will only reflect the light\ncoming at 13.5nm and others will just pass away.\nStep 6: The light then makes the pattern of the mask on the EUV resist coated wafer.\nAdvantages:\n Helps in producing minimum feature size.\n Numbers of transistors have increased successively which have resulted in greater speed.\n Provides high throughput.\n Provides good resolution due to low value of wavelength.\nDisadvantages\n Source Problems\n1. Brightness: The laser producing plasma is too dim .It has a factor of 10-100x and less throughput is\nobtained\n2. Reliability and time problems are commonly faced. EUV process can’t be carried out the whole day\nsince source available is only 0.7 percent and the collector used for tin gets damaged.\n3.

Any defects on the mask that gets printed on the wafer will destroy the wafer and defect free mask\nis required but for EUV defect free mask is not available.\n2. Adequate technology is not available which can easily detect any kind of defect with printing nor\nwe have repair methods, which can easily repair the defects, and also if there is defect in the molten\nlayer, then there is no method to repair that defect.\nPage | 530 Copyright @ 2019 Authors",

In reality only 0.3814th of photons actually make it to the wafer since we know that ranging from\nsource through the mask onto the wafer the reflectivity is 0.7 percent.\n Resist\n1. Resists used are very similar to those used in wavelengths 248 and 193 nm resists\n2. All previous resists had photons hitting at them with energy 6 or 7ev but now the energy is 92ev, so\nwith such high energy hitting the resist, it generates secondary electrons and photon electrons which\nlead to degradation of image quality.\n3. Line width roughness and sensitivity are inversely proportional. Higher the sensitivity lower will be\nthe roughness, which means much higher dose of photons is required to form the patterns, which\ndepict low roughness.\n6. CONCLUSION\nLithography is the base to excel in in the semiconductor industry. For many applications smaller is better in\nterms of speed, power consumption and cost. This paper discussed future lithographic techniques briefly. While\nthe critical dimension in the microprocessor industry is constantly going down; stringent demands should be\nmade on contamination control, yield enhancement and particle detection. There still remains debate over costs\nof many of these methods and the ability to manufacture integrated circuits in large volume. The ability to\nmanufacture small devices is crucial for applications in many different areas including microwave circuits, high-\nspeed optics as well as bio-electronic devices. There is a demand for high-resolution Lithography capability\ncombined with extreme reproducibility over large areas. Historically photolithography has been the dominant\ntechnique for replication since the origin of microelectronic devices. Several other techniques are on the edge of\ntechnological breakthroughs.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Weaver, Peter. (1964) The Technique of Lithography. London: B.T. Batsford, p. 49.\n[2] Meggs, Philip B.
