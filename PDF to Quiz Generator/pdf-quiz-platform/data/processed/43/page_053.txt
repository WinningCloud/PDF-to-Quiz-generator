Module 3
Tools and Methods Used in Cybercrime
Introduction
Different forms of attacks through which attackers target the computer systems are as
follows:
1. Initial uncovering:
 Two steps are involved here.
i. In the first step called as reconnaissance, the attacker gathers information
about the target on the Internet websites.
ii. In the second step, the attacker finds the company’s internal network,
such as, Internet domain, machine names and the company’s Internet
Protocol (IP) address ranges to steal the data.
2. Network probe (investigation):
 At the network probe stage, the attacker scans the organization information through
a “ping sweep” of the network IP addresses.
 Then a “port scanning” tool is used to discover exactly which services are running
on the target system.
 At this point, the attacker has still not done anything that would be considered
as an abnormal activity on the network or anything that can be classified as an
intrusion.
3. Crossing the line toward electronic crime (E-crime):
 Once the attackers are able to access a user account, then they will attempt further
exploits to get an administrator or “root” access.
 Root access is a UNIX term and is associated with the system privileges required
to run all services and access all files on the system (readers are expected to have a
basic familiarity with Unix-based systems).
 “Root” is an administrator or super-user access and grants them the privileges to do
anything on the system.
4. Capturing the network:
 At this stage, the attacker attempts to “own” the network. The attacker gains the
internal network quickly and easily by target systems.
