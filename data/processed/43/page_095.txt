1. URL (weblink) manipulation
• URLs are the weblinks (i.e., Internet addresses) that direct the netizens/users to a
specific website.
• In Phishing attack, these URLs are usually supplied as misspelled, for example,
instead of www.abcbank.com, URL is provided as www.abcbank1.com.
• Phishers use Lobsterpot method of Phishing and make the difference of one or two
letters in the URLs, which is ignored by netizens.
• This makes a big difference and it directs users to a fake/bogus website or a
webpage.
Homograph Attack
• It is used by Phisher to attack on Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) to deceive the
netizens by redirecting them on the phony website which look like the original
website.
• ASCII has several characters and/or pairs of characters which look alike,
• Eg. 0 and “O”. “l” (L lower case) and I(“i” alphabet in uppercase ) [GOOGLE.COM
can be registered as G00GLE.COM]
• Microsoft.com or/rnicrosoft.com
• Phisher could create and register a domain name which appears almost identical to
an existing domain and takes netizens to the Phony websites.
• Phisher could easily record password or account details though spoofed websites,
while passing traffic through the original websites.
2. Filter Evasion
• This technique use graphics (i.e., images) instead of text to obviate from netting
such E-Mails by anti-Phishing filters. Normally, these filters are inbuilt into the web
browsers. For example,
• Internet Explorer version 7 has inbuilt "Microsoft phishing filter." One can enable it
during the installation or it can be enabled post-installation. It is important to note
that it is not enabled by default.
• Firefox 2.0 and above has inbuilt "Google Phishing filter." duly licensed from
Google. It is enabled by default.
• The Opera Phishing filter is dubbed Opera Fraud Protection and is included in
version 9.5+.
3. Website forgery
• In this technique the phisher directs the netizens to the website designed and
developed by him, to login into the website, by altering the browser address bar
through JavaScript commands.
• As the netizen logs into the fake/bogus website, phisher gets the confidential
information very easily.
• Another technique used is known as "cloaked" URL-domain forwarding and/or
inserting control characters into the URL while concealing the weblink address of
the real website.
