 There is no proximity effect since secondary electrons don’t have high energy
 X-Ray light is not absorbed by dirt and even if there is dirt present on the mask, the pattern won’t
get affected
Limitations
 It takes long time for the resist to get exposed.
 It is difficult and costly to manufacture X-Ray masks.
Optical Lithography
Optical Lithography is a process of transferring the pattern from the photographic mask onto the wafer. It is
used in mass-production of ICs with minimum feature size of 250-350 nm. There are three ways of printing in
optical Lithography onto the wafer:
Figure 5. Types of Printing in Optical Lithography
1. Contact Printing: In Contact Printing the wafer and the mask come in close contact with each other, which
makes the life of mask very low but creates a high resolution. It makes use of u- v light of wavelength 300-
400nm. It operates in the Fresnel Diffraction pattern (used to calculate the diffraction pattern created by
waves passing through an aperture or around an object). The tools used here are optical system, wafer,
photoresist film and mask. When the light passes through the optical system, it makes the light incident on
the glass pate. The silicon wafer is coated with photoresist film.
Advantages
 Contact printing provides good resolution of images of about 1 to 0.5µm.
 It is easy to operate and maintain the equipment.
Disadvantages
 Masks may get damaged due to contact with the wafer for a long time, so this technique is only limited
to research labs or applications that can tolerate the defects.
2. Proximity Printing: In proximity printing a gap is maintained between the mask and the wafer, which
makes the life of the mask better but does not provide great resolution. This can help in minimizing the
mask getting damaged but still dust particles may be present and
