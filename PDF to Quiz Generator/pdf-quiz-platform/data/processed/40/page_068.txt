 If the signal is copied then the information is also carried in the copy.
 In other words, when steganography is used to place a hidden “trademark” in images,
music and software, the result is a technique referred to as “watermarking”
Steganalysis
 Steganalysis is the art and science of detecting messages that are hidden in images,
audio/video files using steganography.
 The goal of steganalysis is to identify suspected packages and to determine whether or
not they have a payload encoded into them, and if possible recover it.
 Automated tools are used to detect such steganographed data/information hidden in the
image and audio and/or video files.
Box 4.7 | Difference between Steganography and Cryptography
Steganography is the art and science of writing hidden messages in such a way that no one apart
from the intended recipient knows the existence of the message; this is in contrast to cryptography,
of the message itself is not disguised, but the content is obscured. It is said that terrorists use where
the existence steganography techniques to hide their communication in images on the Internet;
most popular images are used such as those of film actresses or other celebrities. In its basic form,
steganography is simple.
DoS and DDoS Attacks
A denial-of-service attack (DoS attack) or distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS
attack) is an attempt to make a computer resource (i.e., information systems) unavailable to its
intended users.
DoS Attacks
 In this type of criminal act, the attacker floods the bandwidth of the victim’s network
or fills his E-Mail box with Spam mail depriving him of the services he is entitled to access
or provide.
 The attackers typically target sites or services hosted on high-profile web servers such
as banks, credit card payment gateways, mobile phone networks and even root name
servers.
