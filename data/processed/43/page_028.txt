CYBERCRIME ERA: SURVIVAL MANTRA FOR THE NETIZENS
The term “Netizen” was coined by Michael Hauben. Quite simply, “Netizens” are the Internet users. Therefore,
by corollary, “Netizen” is someone who spends considerable time online and also has a considerable presence
online (through websites about the person, through his/her active blog contribution and/or also his/her participation
in the online chat rooms). The 5P Netizen mantra for online security is:
a. Precaution
b. Prevention
c. Protection
d. Preservation
e. Perseverance
For ensuring cyber safety, the motto for the “Netizen” should be “Stranger is Danger!” If you protect
your customer’s data, your employee’s privacy and your own company, then you are doing your job in the grander
scheme of things to regulate and enforce rules on the Net through our community. NASSCOM urges that
cybercrime awareness is important, and any matter should be reported at once. This is the reason they have
established cyberlabs across major cities in India
More importantly, users must try and save any electronic information trail on their computers. That
is all one can do until laws become more stringent or technology more advanced. Some agencies have been
advocating for the need to address protection of the Rights of Netizens. There are agencies that are trying to provide
guidance to innocent victims of cybercrimes. However, these NGO like efforts cannot provide complete support to
the victims of cybercrimes and are unable to get the necessary support from the Police. There are alsoa few
incidents where Police have pursued false cases on innocent IT professionals. The need for a statutorily empowered
agency to protect abuse of ITA 2000 in India was, therefore, a felt need for quite some time.
