Figure 3. Procedure for X-Ray Lithography
Procedure
These are the steps that are to be followed during X-Ray Lithography:
Step 1: The source emits X-Ray light onto the X-Ray mask containing the pattern to be printed.
Step 2: X- Ray masks contain two important structures:
 Absorber: Contains the information to be imaged onto the resist. Since gold has a low atomic no
and is a good absorbing material, it is applied on the top of the x- ray mask. High atomic
number material absorbs X-Rays whereas low atomic number material transmits X-Rays.
 Membrane: X-Ray masks consist of a very thin membrane of low atomic number material
carrying a high atomic number thick absorber pattern.
Step 3: X-Ray resist are of two types as shown in Figure 3:
 Positive resist: Which become soluble when exposed to X-Ray light in the developer solution.
Example: PMMA and PBS. PMMA produces a resolution less than 0.1 whereas PBS produces
a resolution of 0.5 [10]
 Negative resist: The portion, which is exposed to light, doesn’t dissolve in the developer
solution. Example: COP (An epoxy copolymer of glycidyl methacrylate and ethyl acrylate)
which produces a resolution of 1.0.

Advantages
 Reduces the limit of diffraction since shorter wavelength of light is used.
 It can produce feature size as small as 20nm.
 It produces high resolution and less through put.
